<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>&#8211;  application deadline extended to 30th August! &#8211;</strong><br><br><strong>2023 online and residential course<br>17th October &#8211; 9th December 2023<br></strong><br>An invitation to take part in a participatory, transformative learning programme for social and environmental practitioners, (post)activists, change-makers and everyone else interested in exploring ideas and practices for economies of care, solidarity, belonging and social and ecological justice within planetary limits. The programme combines online sessions over seven weeks with a four day residential learning retreat at Whatton Lodge, Gullane, East Lothian. It is delivered jointly by Enough! Scotland and the <a href="https://www.che.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Centre for Human Ecology</a>.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Key components of the course:</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">• Weekly online sessions: Tuesdays 7pm &#8211; 9pm, Oct 17th – Dec 5th 2023</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">• A residential learning retreat and field trip, <a href="https://whattonlodge.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whatton Lodge, Gullane</a>, Nov 16th-20th</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">• Co-learning lab and gathering, 9th Dec (Central Scotland, venue tbc) : final event with sharing of participants’ learning</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">• Self-directed study: through a course handbook, online resources and a practice-based inquiry / study / creative exploration.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">• At least three additional peer group meetings will be held over the period of the course (times to be agreed by participants)</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Description</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In times marked by accelerating climate breakdown, and social ad economic volatility, uncertainty and complexity, the knowledge and skills required to understand and navigate the metacrisis call for new forms of education and community.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We will explore together where we are now, how we got here, and what we can do about it. DE/GROWTH means engaging with the framing and literature on degrowth: new economic thinking in response to biophysical limits &#8211; such as redistribution of resources, work and, global solidarity &#8211; while drawing on the deep roots of human ecology to explore belonging in relation to communities of place, climate justice and ecological sustainability.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">During the course, together we’ll create a collaborative learning community around the core themes, and create ripples to embed principles and practices of degrowth and human ecology among community and climate activists across Scotland. We draw upon methods taken from popular education practice, building on a rich heritage of radical pedagogy.<br></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Residential</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The residential takes place at Whatton Lodge, Gullane, East Lothian, home of Lothian Mineworkers Convalescent Home Trust, which was set-up in 1948 to provide breaks and respite for ex-miners and their families after serious accidents or illness. Situated by the Gullane sand dunes, with a gate to the beach, the home of this year’s residential offers a beautiful and comfortable setting for learning, as well as a suitable venue to reflect on the meaning and memory of deindustrialisation in Scotland and its legacy of extractivism and inequality, which will be explored in the course content.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The residential is a transformative learning community in microcosm: designed to complement the online sessions with in-person collaboration and cooperation around the learning content and other group activities. It has four main components: learning sessions exploring human ecology, degrowth, the solidarity economy, and regenerative cultures, guided experiences engaging with land/waterscapes and each other,: peer groups meeting to discuss and inquire into their questions together, open space where participants self-organise sessions around specific topics or activities: and place-based learning from the community and bioregion. And no residential is complete without a self-organised ceilidh!<br><br>Please note that travel to and from the residential must be met by participants individually. If these are a barrier, please let us know when completing the application form below and we may be able to support your travel.<br></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Who is the course for?</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">People normally based in (or with a connection to) Scotland who are active in their community and/or activist groups and keen to learn with like-minded peers. We encourage those who may not ordinarily have opportunities to take part in a course like this and will aim to accommodate barriers you may have to participating. Please get in touch and let us know if there is anything which might prevent you from taking part.<br></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>What you need to commit to:</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We are making the course available for all to participate in, regardless of finances, but this does not mean that it is &#8216;free&#8217; in an absolute sense. There is no charge for the course as it is fully funded by Enough! Scotland. However, delivering this course requires resources, labour and money; and places are limited. So please only apply for a place on the course if you can reasonably expect to be able to fully participate in all components for the duration of the course. The course comprises of 7 two-hour online workshops (delivered via Zoom), a four day residential, and an online virtual learning environment in which course readings and resources, and discussion threads are accessed.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As part of the course, participants will be asked to conduct a personal action inquiry into a question of their choosing related to the course themes, and to share the results of this inquiry with the course cohort in the final session, in whichever format/ creative medium they choose (for example, a poster presentation, a text, talk, artwork, or workshop). This will comprise a Co-Learning Lab and gathering on the 9<sup>th</sup> December 2023, in which the knowledge created during the course will be shared more widely.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Participants, upon completing the course, will be eligible to receive a Certificate of Completion. As part of our ongoing inquiry into co-operative and alternative economic practices, participants will have the opportunity to explore ways to contribute to the course, and associated activity by means of knowledge exchange, skillsharing and collaboration. This includes the opportunity to contribute to the educational charitable work of the Centre for Human Ecology by making a one-off or regular financial contribution of the education co-operative via our <a href="https://opencollective.com/che/donate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenCollective platform</a>, 100% of which will go towards developing future educational work.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>How to apply:</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In order to apply, please complete a short form outlining why you would like to take part in the course. Our courses are generally oversubscribed, which means that we have to select participants. We select participants using the criteria of creating a diverse group of peer-learners based on the information you provide in the application form.</p>

<p><strong>An online collaborative learning programme with a residential learning retreat / field trip to Ullapool, run in partnership by the <a href="http://www.che.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Centre for Human Ecology</a> and Enough! Scotland.<br><br>The programme consists of&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>A weekly online session: <strong>Wednesdays 6.30pm &#8211; 8.30pm, <strong>Sept 14th &#8211; Nov 16th 2022</strong></strong></strong></li>



<li><strong>A residential learning retreat and field trip in the Ceilidh Place, Ullapool Oct 10th-14th.</strong></li>



<li><strong>Self-directed study: through a course handbook, online resources and a practice-based inquiry / study / creative exploration.&nbsp;</strong></li>



<li><strong>3 additional peer group meetings will be held over the period of the course (times to be agreed by each group)</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><strong><br>Description: </strong>An invitation to social and environmental practitioners, community workers and activists working in Scotland to collaboratively explore how the principles of degrowth and radical human ecology can inform and catalyse change. A 10-week programme, delivered as a partnership between Enough! Scotland and the Centre for Human Ecology, including a 4 night residential learning retreat and field trip at the Ceilidh Place in Ullapool in the Scottish Highlands.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>In times marked by an accelerating climate crisis, we explore together what degrowth could look like in Scotland, through a framing of human ecology and systems thinking. We understand ‘degrowth’ as meaning intergenerational social, ecological and migrant justice through decolonisation and equity within planetary limits – and this includes growth of socially and ecologically beneficial activity. The aim of this course is to create ripples to embed principles and practices of degrowth and human ecology among community and climate activists across Scotland. The course consists of a weekly online session with a talk followed by discussion, as well as readings for self-directed study. A key component of the course is to co-create a community of practice and peer-learning , which will be supported through a series of online peer group meetings and an in-depth 3.5-day (4 nights) residential in Ullapool. We draw upon methods taken from popular education and anti-oppression practices, peer-coaching and practical and immersive exercises.</p>



<p>The course takes place in the 50th anniversary year of the founding of the Centre for Human Ecology and the publication of Limits to Growth. We look forward to forming a learning community with you.</p>



<p><strong>Course format:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>8 online sessions:</strong> Each session will consist of a presentation on key themes in degrowth and human ecology, followed by a facilitated group discussion and break-out groups to digest the material.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Peer group meetings:</strong> There will be three additional online peer group meetings at times to be agreed by each group, and time dedicated to peer groups at the residential, in person.</p>



<p><strong>Contributors: </strong>Bronagh Gallagher, <a href="https://degrowth.org/lorenzo-velotti/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lorenzo Velotti</a>, Luke Devlin, <a href="http://www.mairimcfadyen.scot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr Mairi McFadyen</a>, <a href="https://www.rolandplayle.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roland Playle</a> and <a href="https://www.che.ac.uk/people/svenja-meyerricks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr Svenja Meyerricks</a>, with others to be announced</p>



<p><strong>Who is the course for? </strong>A key aim of the course is to develop the knowledge and capability of degrowth and human ecology principles among community and climate activists in Scotland. Participants are encouraged to either be normally resident in Scotland, or have another significant connection or interest.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Costs:</strong> Course fees are set on a sliding-scale, meaning you can choose the fee you are able to pay and we trust that this is the right amount for you. If you are in a position to pay the base cost rate or more either from your own income or from organisational training budgets, it will enable us to offer the course to others in the future. <strong>We also do not want finances to be a barrier to accessing the course and you are invited to pay what you are able to.</strong> Recommended scale*:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>£850+</strong> <em>supporter rate for those on a very comfortable income / large organisations</em></li>



<li><strong>£450</strong> <em>base costs for comfortable income / medium sized organisations</em></li>



<li><strong>£0 to £200</strong> <em>subsidised rate for</em> <em>low income / small organisations / no access to training budget</em></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong><em>As we (un)settle into 2022, the Enough! collective are reflecting on the profound lessons we are learning from the pandemic, the critical problems that were exposed through COP26 and the ongoing crisis of the British State: and asking what it means for those working in resistance and struggle. </em></strong></p>



<p>There is no single story that defines what COP26 was. Inside the blue zone, there was hardly a trace of the red zone: the COP was held by a half-arsed host nation, and the entire spectacle demonstrated the current global political leadership‘s profound lack of political will to face the scale of the crisis. </p>



<p>This piece attempts to provide analysis of the misses and fails, as well as uplift all that was positive. Beyond success/failure binaries, many outcomes were less tangible, subtle and complex. In doing this, we hope we can learn from them to inform better strategies for building a more effective climate movement in Scotland and globally.</p>



<p>Apart from hosting a series of workshops on degrowth, Enough! members participated as individuals in different ways across COP26. As a collective, were not directly active in the COP26 Coalition or other mobilisations, so our views are offered humbly and with profound respect to those who were organising in the thick of it. This piece is offered as a post-it note to ourselves, our collaborators and the wider movement, in which we take stock of where we left things in 2021, and what we might want to pick up from here.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-were-the-outcomes-of-the-talks">What were the outcomes of the talks? </h2>



<p>Within the climate movement, COP26 is largely viewed as a failure. Taking current policies as a baseline, which would have us hurtling towards 2.7 degrees of heating by the end of the century, the climate action tracker warned mid-summit that the complete inadequacy of 2030 targets reveals a massive credibility, action and commitment gap. Meanwhile, outside of the climate movement, governments and media have been quick to paint it as major progress.</p>



<p>While the implications for climate policy have been analysed in detail elsewhere, some systemic key failings of COP26 mean that business as usual is structurally baked into specific outcomes and the efforts they translate to.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>The heavy emphasis on carbon markets as the way to tackle climate emergency undermines urgent emission cuts needed and shifts pollution from one place to another</li></ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>No commitment to Loss and Damage &#8211; a key demand from global south nations that would allow reparations and a small step towards justice in covering the increasing devastation caused by climate breakdown.</li></ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>The subtle shift in soft power shaping how COP plays out. In a debriefing hosted by the Rosa Luxemburg Foundation three notable features emerged: Firstly, the shift by powerful nations in using the COP to make announcements of climate commitments rather than reach agreements through negotiations. Secondly, the backtracking by powerful nations of previously fought for and won issues, like the centrality of human rights. And thirdly, the significant number of ways in which input and influence by smaller nations and blocs was minimised through accessibility &#8211; limited event capacity; the lack of translation&nbsp;and much more.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-does-this-all-mean">What does this all mean?</h2>



<p>We will not be able to limit warming to 1.5 degrees, say for example, Harpreet Kaur Paul and Dalia Gebrial, Jason Hickel and the COP26 Coalition. The consequences of a warming world will aggravate and intensify existing injustices.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>In total, agreements made have been described as a ‘death sentence’ to the poorest people on the planet. Simply put, not enough progress was made to protect those who are most vulnerable.</li></ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>The scope of meaningful influence by smaller nations is deliberately being minimised and we have to ask why?&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>The severe limitations of responses to climate emergency that rely on strong leadership by people and countries who will be more interested in maintaining their current positions.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-happened-on-the-ground">What happened on the ground? </h2>



<p>The failure of the official talks was met and highlighted by masses of bodies on the streets. For two weeks there was a consistent volume of internal and external protests &#8211; outside big fossil banks, road blocking of elite dinners, the occupation of Bailie Hoose, the 100,000+ march, the coming together of climate strikers and trade union picket lines, and a whole range of smaller actions.&nbsp;The COP26 Coalition’s activities built an infrastructure between individuals and groups. This feels like an important, positive legacy to nurture an interconnectedness between groups across the country and globally, and demonstrates our ability to mobilise.</p>



<p>COPs are perceived as an annual opportunity to amplify voices of indigenous communities and small states who are bearing the brunt of the ongoing extractive colonial global project. Participants in the fringe events around COP26 we spoke to said that while they felt cynical about the processes in the fortified blue zone, the human encounters they experienced in the civic spaces felt transformative, amplifying our learning and understanding about the crisis in myriad ways beyond abstractions. However, many conversations with with Glaswegians, who were not active participants highlighted a feeling of COP26 being something happening to them and to the city. A disconnected disruption. After many long months of having pandemic related restrictions (Glasgow experiencing some of the more strict restrictions) imposed on people and lives made small, suddenly hundreds of thousands of people filled (or blocked) the streets, clarifying the very different realities of our lives. </p>



<p>At activist and arts venues around the city, beyond the COP26 Coalition’s daily movement assemblies and countless fringe events hosted by local organisations, there were rituals and ceremonies happening involving both hosts and guests. </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>The all-female Zapatistas delegation from Chiapas, Mexico shared the story of their struggle of gaining autonomy at venues around the city, Scotland and Europe.</li><li>The Indian feminist street art collective Fearless,who work to foster dialogue about community stories and healing collective trauma through reclamation of public space, was in Glasgow to complete a mural in collaboration with Brazilian Amazonian leaders. The powerful mural they gifted to the city overlooks Merchant City, steeped in Glasgow’s colonial legacy.</li></ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>The Minga Indigena, a collective of leaders, organisations and communities from indigenous nations throughout Abya Yala (the American continent) came to Glasgow from different indigenous communities, language groups and bioregional extremes. Supporting their gathering spaces meant supporting pan-Indigenous organising. The group visited community and arts spaces around the city and shared rituals, exhibits, songs and laments, grieving about the violence and killings land defenders have been experiencing in their territories. </li></ul>



<p>While there is a tendency in the environmental movement to glamourise or ‘other’ indigenous peoples, local participants in the events around COP remarked that the encounters felt more grounded in this context. The violence and threats faced by land defenders on the front line of the impacts of climate change is unfathomable to those of us cushioned by hundreds of years of benefiting from land grabs, extractivism, class-based oppression and colonial history. Yet, there was a recognition that the continuation of the same principles and mechanisms now threaten all our life support systems. Central to many organising groups was a duty of care and responsibility to not spread Covid-19, particularly amongst BIPOC activists. &nbsp;</p>



<p>On the last official day of the COP26 negotiations, the People’s Decision for Climate Justice&nbsp;announced at the People’s Plenary in the blue zone reflected these common concerns, calling for debt cancellation, a “fair share phase out” to equitably eliminate fossil fuels from the global economy in time to limit warming below 1.5°C, resisting carbon markets and excluding big polluters from the UNFCCC process, while making it truly inclusive and democratically accountable. A series of speeches by young activists with disabilities and from indigenous communities preceded the decision. Ta’Kaiya Blaney, a member of Canada’s Tla’Amin First Nation, called the summit a performance &#8211; “an illusion constructed to salvage capitalist economies rooted in resource extraction and colonialism”. The plenary was followed by a walk-out of the blue zone in a procession, past many delegates, past the logos of the conference’s corporate sponsors, past the electric Formula One car displayed in the main conference space in all its glorious offensiveness, past the security gates and finally joining protesters outside. </p>



<p>While the walk-outs of UNFCCC conferences have happened at every COP over the past decade or so, they constitute an embodied stance that words itself cannot adequately convey. The walk-outs communicate that those with the most skin in the game reject the entire UNFCCC process as it stands, and demand deep and wide-ranging transformations that take resisting current and historic systemic violence as a starting point for any acceptable climate solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="policing-and-performative-democracy-on-the-streets">Policing and performative democracy on the streets</h2>



<p>COP26 was ‘one of the most high profile and significant security and policing events ever held in the United Kingdom’. Headlines and PR from Police Scotland declared the policing of COP26 a success, pointing to the relatively small number of arrests. The policing of the 100,000+ march on Saturday 6 November was also framed as successful. What was less visible was a culture of fear and intimidation that can be understood as a strategic decision by the police. Early stages of COP26 saw considerable numbers of reports from activists of intimidation and harassment. Local residents in key areas experienced the unsettling impact of a high police presence. The intimidation culture was so notable as to warrant letters from the COP26 Coalition and Amnesty International to Nicola Sturgeon and an extensive strategy report by Netpol. It was noted that the culture of intimidation established early by the police, resulted in many planned actions not taking place and people, particularly, BPOC, working-class and disabled people noted feeling unsafe and uncomfortable at the amount of policing. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What meaning can we make of all this? And how might it inform how we resist and effect change?</strong></p>



<p>Given that the walk-outs and protests in the blue zone are pre-approved, the road blockages and lock-ons were minimally and superficially disruptive to decision-makers and that many of the 100,000 + people who marched just went home and got on with their lives, it feels like a deeper examination on the purpose and form of protest, both at COPs and beyond in the face of climate emergency, is urgently needed. While spaces of meaningful influence on the actual outcomes of talks were actively being minimised, the largely surface impact of external protest, easily managed by a well-prepared police presence, and mandated nature of blue zone disruption could suggest that there is a permitted amount of resistance and protest allowed in order to provide the veneer of democratic legitimacy to the talks, while decisions were made which entrench position and power.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Are we witnessing protest itself being co-opted to maintain an illusion of democratic process? This needs to be monitored and carefully understood . This line of thought takes us into deeper and disturbing reflections. In many ways, COP26 can be experienced as a performance; a staged play repeated for the 26th time. Consciously or not, everyone played a role in conjuring the illusion that the proceedings could secure the radical change needed. There were good people (in and out of the blue zone) and bad people, and everyone stuck to the script. &nbsp;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-does-this-say-about-what-next">What does this say about what next?</h2>



<p>Surveying all that COP was &#8211; the clear inadequacy of the formal process balanced, the hostile policing context, the importance of immersion but the challenge of building on and diffusing that, the more grounded strengths that COP participation offers, enough!&nbsp;are drawing the following conclusions:</p>



<p><strong>Clearer articulations of theories of change are needed, </strong>including an assessment of the degree to which multilateral governance arrangements which have co-evolved with and been shaped by dynamics of capital are ever going to be sufficient to truly disrupt, tame and wind down fossil fuel capitalism. Of course, this doesn&#8217;t automatically suggest there is nothing to be gained from participation in COP; the presence of blocs from global south and indigenous groups is clearly essential. It just seems to suggest that participation by Civil Society needs thoughtful analysis about the who, why, how and to what end, particularly if powerful actors are subtly making meaningful participation increasingly challenging. Additionally, if protesting around COP is a role of Civil Society, and particularly considering the risk of co-option outlined above, we must work towards a&nbsp; clearer understanding of what protest can realistically achieve and which tactics serve best our goals within the COP context and our wider movements.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Climate action needs to focus less on multilateral governance and more on weakening and disrupting the dynamics of capitalism and colonialism.</strong> Three aspects are important here. First, globally, we are already living the undeniable reality of accelerating climate breakdown and ecosystem collapse and it will get worse. Second, the science is unequivocal on the time the global north has left to reduce emissions to stay within our carbon budget. Finally, as is emerging from above, COP processes appear structurally unable to facilitate the breakdown and break-up of (fossil fuel) capitalism and we cannot wait another year to start taking action on whatever can be achieved from within existing institutional means.</p>



<p><strong>To get beyond diagnosis and description, there is need to actually strategise for taking on capitalism and target dynamics of how capitalism is currently working. </strong>This includes financialisation, public private partnerships, large infrastructure developments owned by equity firms, the climate courts. Throughout COP26 protests, eloquent speeches clearly named the problem as capitalism and (neo)colonialism. If the problem is capitalism, acknowledging that the movement and flow of capital was completely unaffected by the formal outcomes of the process and the mass mobilisation of energy and resources during the two weeks of COP feels like a helpful reality check.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="understanding-the-context-for-taking-action">Understanding the context for taking action</h2>



<p>It seems clear that the UK government sees growing disruption as at worst an inconvenience and at best a threat. With heavy sentencing for recent roadblocks and worrying legislative developments, we need to ask how an emerging strategy for taking on capitalism can work with this emerging reality and ensure that tactics work with this situational awareness. For example, in what ways can we utilise the likelihood of increased repression to build support, what other tactics exist that might be less easy to police but can effectively target and disrupt key dynamics and how do we bring sufficient numbers of new people into taking action so that we become ungovernable?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="for-enough-lessons-and-clues-come-from-many-places">For enough!, lessons and clues come from many places.</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Where COP protest seemed to have legacy, traction and meaning was when it connected to local struggles. Baile Hoose, the Maryhill action in which Maryhill Against Closures turned up to support a road blockage by climate activists, and climate activists supporting trade union picket lines. The combination of community organising, direct action and union mobilisation feels like it is suggesting useful directions.</li></ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Of all the things that 2021 was, Kenmure Street remains instructive &#8211; direct action that was supported and enabled by significant numbers of local community members both provided the on-the-day numbers to make more interventionist police action a mistake and the post-event legitimacy needed to offset divisive framings of ‘activists’ and ‘mobs’.</li></ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>22 years ago the ‘Battle of Seattle’ shut down the WTO. At the time this was a fresh and audacious tactic with the police completely unprepared.It effectively disrupted the actual functioning of the WTO. In doing so, it created a template for activist responses to elite multilateralism. 22 years later, it was the same template at COP. The protests and roadblocks were the expected and normalised response. The police were ready, precautions were taken. The official business took place behind militarised security. We can take two things from this: the element of surprise is important and critical, while WTO talks were briefly shut down and offered symbolic fuel to movements, long-term tangible impacts on the WTO agenda were minimal. What does this say about how we conceive meaningful action?</li></ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Early COP debriefs amplified calls from global south actors that the global north movement must be more internationalist and must be ready to support, in whatever way that looks like, the actions of global south workers and activists. Recognising that we are all shaped by the same dynamics but experience them differently &#8211; high consumption in the north, sites of production in the south &#8211; suggests ways of grappling with this which bring the two together.</li></ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Indigenous resistance in the US and Canada to fossil fuel projects has been directly credited with reducing billions of tonnes of emissions (Oil Change International Research). Meanwhile, activist resistance to the development of the CAMBO oil field created unfavourable conditions for Shell to invest. Both created ‘hostile environments’ for corporate developments.</li></ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>The increased focus on the root cause of the climate crisis and interconnected other crises being capitalism at this COP brought different struggles and forms of injustice together &#8211; unifying intersectional struggles for climate justice, social and class justice.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p></p>



<p><strong>These are the kinds of reflections and questions that we carry with us as we move through the year ahead. </strong></p>



<p><strong>We want to be in conversation with people and groups across Scotland who are also actively exploring new ways of responding. We have created <a href="https://www.hylo.com/groups/enough-cop26-reflection-forum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Hylo group</a>, to provide a space where all who attended, observed and/or were impacted by COP26, can collectively think through these ideas together and lay the groundwork for future in-person discussions and actions.   </strong></p>

<p>There is much talk about ‘Green Economy’ or ‘Green Growth’ as the main solution to climate change. In this teach-in we will examine the fundamental problems of the narratives of Green Growth, how it is preserving a status quo that will further accelerate climate breakdown. In the second part, we’ll take a look at Degrowth as an alternative for a just and social transformation of our society.</p>

<p>Degrowth, while a general critique of our global state of affairs, is fundamentally a situated approach and makes sense for the Global South as an anti-colonial project. Green Growth is pushed as a new language of imperialism in places like Chile and in “energy transitions” initiatives. This teach-in highlights the resistance to the “growth at all costs” that emerges from communities defending their territories and different cosmologies and frames degrowth as a project of global solidarity and human needs.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">We are currently seeking contributions to our upcoming issue <strong>LESS #3</strong>:<strong> Degrowth and Decolonisation in the Red Zone</strong></h3>



<p>The recent<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> IPPC report</a> signals the latest three-alarm warning for humanity and the biosphere. It&#8217;s a red alert for the &#8216;red zone&#8217;- those areas of our planet responsible for the most emissions, which are also now squarely in the floodplain- including Scotland. </p>



<p>Beyond COP26, we invite contributions that focus on Scottish resistance to the climate crisis. The story emerging so far on the road to COP26 from mainstream commentators and media, party politics and corporate PR is that we can carry on industrial civilisation as per usual, by simply inserting a renewably-powered battery in the same old machine. This approach will almost certainly lead to collapse. Rather, we&#8217;re interested in clues and trails that lead away from this collision with planetary limits.  We seek responses that reflect grounded lived practice and fresh-thinking through degrowth and decolonisation to create a future-focused and outward looking climate justice movement. This needs innovation that responds to our times, as well as recovering traditional ecological and cultural knowledge, especially within a Scottish context, which can help restore fragments of meaning in our times of metacrisis. <br><br><strong>Submissions:</strong> We invite a combination of thoroughly researched material, opinion pieces, poetry and art work from those with lived knowledge in these areas, researchers, poets, creative writers and artists. If you&#8217;re interested in submitting a piece, please have a look at our <a href="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LESS.pdf">guidelines for contributors</a> and send us a short summary or abstract of your idea to less@enough.scot asap. We aim to have selected contributors by the end of August. The deadline for finished pieces is 4th October, and we pay a fee of £240.</p>



<p><strong>LESS is a journal on degrowth, radical sufficiency and decolonisation in Scotland.</strong> LESS questions and challenges dominant narratives about what economic progress means in Scotland, and sketches out alternative visions. The focus is on collective and democratic solutions to sustaining livelihoods that meet people’s needs while rising to the threats of climate change, ecocide and mass extinction, inequality, racism and the far right, and the interconnected oppressive and extractivist logic and mechanisms that feed all of those.<br><br><strong>Editorial team:</strong> Mike Small, Dr Mairi McFadyen, Dr Svenja Meyerricks and Luke Devlin</p>

<p><strong>by Alis Le May</strong></p>



<p>This is from #2 of LESS – our journal of degrowth, radical sufficiency and decolonisation in Scotland. <a href="https://www.enough.scot/less/">Details of how to get a print copy here.</a></p>



<p></p>



<p>The fashion industry is among the most polluting industries on the planet. It is fraught with ethical atrocities, inherently resource-hungry and, some might claim, entirely unnecessary – in utilitarian terms we have produced enough clothing and textiles to meet the needs of our global population for generations.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, we remain unsated and, even in the face of a global economic recession (combined with a growing awareness of the imminent, terrifying consequences of overconsumption), it is predicted that this year we will <em>still</em> produce over 100 billion garments.<a href="#sdendnote1sym"><sup>i</sup></a></p>



<p>It seems like a kind of madness, a collective hysteria so deeply entrenched and on such a scale that it almost forbids confrontation. But the future of our species demands that we change; the unacceptable exploitation of garment workers demands that we change; the current levels of pollution in our rivers, our oceans and our soil demand that we change.</p>



<p>This article aims to illustrate how a revitalised, locally made clothing economy is a degrowth approach that would create meaningful employment, enrich communities and challenge toxic mindsets about how we view ourselves, each other and the clothing we inhabit.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>



<p>Imagine a city, and in this city are 30 bespoke tailors, making suits and coats for their clients. The tailors have known and provided service to their clients for decades. They know about each other’s families, hobbies, hopes and disappointments. Their lives are interconnected &#8211; tailor and client, friend and neighbour, citizens of a shared place. Now imagine 23 dressmakers, creating outfits for their clients in every colour of the rainbow, realising dreams of wedding dresses, or the perfect summer blouse. They too form relationships; the exchange of money is necessary, but it does not corrode the connection. There exists a respect for learned craft and design talent, for listening and for creativity. There is something special, and ultimately something deeply human here. Now imagine 22 shirtmakers, 21 milliners (hat makers) and 5 shoemakers, all building those relationships, honing their crafts, and existing in this diverse marketplace of locally made clothing. And the craftspeople of this great, diverse, creative city are not hidden out of sight in obscure back-lanes or industrial zones- they are in the heart of bustling city life, with visible shop fronts on high streets for all the population to see, know, and feel that good things are made here.</p>



<p>This is not a utopia or a dream that I am describing, neither is it London’s Mayfair (one of the last great remaining districts of craftspeople in the United Kingdom). What I am describing is the city of Glasgow in 1968<a href="#sdendnote2sym"><sup>ii</sup></a>, a city with a population similar in size to today’s, where poverty was rife &#8211; yet it supported a local industry of skilled craftspeople. If population and wealth are any indicators, the city should be able to support a visible local clothing industry now, so why not make clothes in Glasgow? Why not make clothes locally in Scotland? Why not grow new (and support existing) locally made clothing economies around the globe? I believe that looking to our past is more than an exercise in bittersweet nostalgia, but instead could help inform a blueprint for a sustainable future.</p>



<p>A locally made clothing economy is by nature a degrowth economy; recent research estimates that the global fashion industry will produce over 100 billion garments this year<a href="#sdendnote3sym"><sup>iii</sup></a>. This is an incredibly hard figure to visualise. It would be unlikely to see those numbers replicated in a global industry formed of localised clothing economies, and powered by individuals and small teams of makers. The fantastic thing about degrowth (inherent in switching to a localised economy) is that you can gather support for rebuilding a diverse, local marketplace from a much broader section of the population than those who might typically engage with critiques of capitalism – and without ever mentioning the term “degrowth”.</p>



<p>In the UK alone it is estimated that the fashion industry spends £241 million on advertising<a href="#sdendnote4sym"><sup>iv</sup></a>. With increasingly powerful tactics, facilitated by social media platforms and the cultures that have emerged from them, a growth-focused fashion industry is in a better position than ever to convince us to buy, dispose, repeat. A small brand in Dundee making t-shirts, or a tailor in Edinburgh making bespoke suits, might employ the occasional use of online adverts, or use social media platforms to promote their business. Their powers of persuasion however, and ability to purchase space in the ‘attention economy’, pale in comparison to big brands, (particularly those with high-status associations) and they lack an incentive to seize the attention of whole nations with large campaigns. It is my belief that a fashion industry constituted from thousands of small and micro businesses, would create a very different culture of consumption.</p>



<p>In our current context, where there exists an urgent need for reducing material consumption, the inherent production limitations of local brands and makers becomes their strength. This is absolutely the case with small, localised fashion brands (producing limited runs of ‘ready-to-wear’ collections). Taking this further, in terms of limiting unnecessary consumption and changing buying habits, some of the most interesting (and often overlooked) potential lies in bespoke. A bespoke garment sits outside the mainstream fashion industry, is not subject to trends and does not require an advertising campaign. It is a carefully considered purchase, partly due to the expense involved in purchasing it, but for deeper reasons too – it requires consideration, thought, discussion and collaboration between customer and maker. Commissioning a bespoke garment is a ‘high friction’ transaction; fabric must be chosen, shape decided upon, number of pockets agreed etc. and that is before the making can even begin, with some, more complex bespoke garments requiring 6 or more months to create. It requires real consideration and it also requires patience, two practices the ‘low friction’ experience of shopping ready-to-wear online would have us avoid and ultimately forget how to exercise.</p>



<p>The term ‘bespoke’ has become synonymous with tailoring, in particular luxury tailoring, but, when I write ‘bespoke’, I am not just referring to three-piece formal suits. It is defined as ‘made for a particular customer or user’ and so, today, a bespoke clothing economy (as part of a wider, local clothing marketplace) would more likely manifest in bespoke jeans, bespoke sweatshirts, bespoke t-shirts and bespoke casual dresses. In fact, any item of clothing you are wearing right now could be bespoke. In the last 100 years, societies across the globe have challenged every kind of clothing rule and taboo, whilst becoming gradually entrenched in thinking that clothing <em>must</em> come from brands, not fellow citizens. If people were able to re-engage with the concept of buying bespoke, the possibilities for true individual expression and creativity reach new heights. In this way, a degrowth clothing economy is not about austerity and reducing individual freedoms; it is about increasing creativity and empowering self-expression in a way that the current mainstream fashion industry does not allow.</p>



<p>Wasteful and resource hungry is the true state of the fashion industry today. Entirely preventable waste occurs at every stage of its production, sale and use. Some waste is difficult to prevent; for example, in order to avoid producing waste fabric offcuts during production, garments would need to be designed using a zero-waste approach and this can be challenging (but not impossible) for mainstream brands to implement. The mass burning or burying of unsold garments to protect brand identity is a practice that is hard to defend. Burberry was famously outed for this practice<a href="#sdendnote5sym"><sup>v</sup></a> but they are only one of the many companies adopting this strategy for a problem which is simply ‘just having too much stuff’. This story provoked public outrage but, if we picture it at a personal level, it can be easier to comprehend. How many of us have ever felt overwhelmed at the number of possessions we have (be that clothing or something else) and, in a fit of ‘decluttering’, condemned bags of unwanted items to the local charity shop or, in more desperate moments, the bin. If we are to tangibly tackle the problem of textile waste, we must acknowledge that responsibility exists with, and beyond, global brands. We too have an impact &#8211; currently it is estimated that the global population sends the equivalent of a rubbish truck of clothing to landfill every second<a href="#sdendnote6sym"><sup>vi</sup></a>.</p>



<p>When we hear statistics about tonnage of textile waste, we can start to feel its burden build upon our backs, to the point where we feel paralysed, incapable of meaningful action. One of the many exciting things about a revitalised, locally made clothing economy is that it gives us tools to not only reduce the amount of waste we produce, but also to begin to see “waste” in an entirely different way.</p>



<p>Firstly, a fashion industry composed of small brands and makers would not have the manufacturing capability to create anywhere near the same levels of waste that we are witnessing right now. It is also unlikely that smaller businesses would ever need or want to burn or bury unsold garments. When you are directly connected to the making process, you are much more invested in your garments because you have been a part of the hours it took to create them. It would be a very unusual set of circumstances that would cause an independent designer to burn a collection they had spent several months creating. I <em>still </em>have pieces I made from when I was first learning how to sew (over a decade ago), and I expect that I will still have those pieces in 10 years’ time.</p>



<p>A strong local clothing economy is likely to be a connected and social network, able to share resources and facilities to reduce waste and production costs for all. Taking an example from my own practice; prior to the pandemic, most of my commissions were wedding dresses or men’s suits – traditional styles for formal occasions &#8211; and these clients were not interested in experimenting with interesting seam placement that could minimise waste. Why should they be? Even with the most economical lay plan (the way pattern pieces are nestled together for cutting, kind of like Tetris), I always produce small waste pieces that will very rarely be of use to me. In a connected, diverse local clothing economy, I would know exactly who those scraps would be useful to; in this way one designers’ trash becomes another designers’ treasure, waste and costs are reduced for both parties, and a culture of reciprocity would emerge.</p>



<p>Independent designers and makers are much more agile than global brands; they can quickly make use of pre- and post-consumer waste whenever opportunities present themselves or even make it a central part of their business model. In fact, they are already leading the way in this. Taking an example from Glasgow, upcycling brand ReJean Denim repurposes deadstock denim and preloved jeans into new, timeless pieces and offers a mending service to make sure the garment has as long a life as possible. This requires skill, but it also requires imagination – seeing waste as an opportunity, rather than a problem.</p>



<p>Exploring the problem of waste imaginatively &#8211; how long might a city such as Glasgow be able to sustain a diverse, creative clothing economy if all materials had to be sourced with city limits? Given the huge number of garments languishing in charity shops, clothing bins, textile recycling centres and even our own wardrobes, I doubt that designers would find themselves too limited if they only sourced their textiles locally – and, if they did, might it be worth exploring the value of this limitation? And might we start to question the notion that creative endeavour should never be limited, no matter the costs to our environment? Like most cities, we have fantastic local textile resources; we may not be able to grow cotton in Scotland, but we certainly have a lot of cotton right here already to work with. Truly imaginative designers can work with what they have in front of them, and we have so much.</p>



<p>The fast fashion culture we currently live in inevitably compromises quality to deliver at such a pace. Of course, there have always been varying levels of quality throughout the history of clothing production, but it is only in the last 50 or 60 years that we have seen the prevalence of planned obsolescence grow in the fashion industry. The big brands do not expect you to wear their garments more than 8-10 times, so why take the extra time in production to make them last 300 washes? A local clothing economy cannot exist in this manner. Local businesses depend on customer loyalty, online reviews, and word-of-mouth to maintain their clients. Furthermore, a disgruntled customer in a local clothing economy can have a greater impact than simply leaving a bad review; they can walk into your shop or visit your studio and demand a repair or refund in person. There is accountability, a necessary aspect of any healthy community.</p>



<p>Designers who have a role in the production of their collections will see the value in making something well for its own sake (the philosophy of a craftsman<a href="#sdendnote7sym"><sup>vii</sup></a>) and, with many designers running ‘own name’ labels, who would want their name on a poorly made garment? Moreover, when you are working with or selling directly toa customer, there forms a human connection, a sense of obligation – that person has chosen <em>you</em> to make something, something that will touch their skin, keep them warm, change the way they feel about themselves. Amancio Ortega, billionaire and owner of Inditex (a fashion conglomerate that includes Zara, Bershka and Massimo Dutti) is unlikely to lose sleep when your Zara t-shirt starts to fall apart or when your jeans zip has broken after 2 wears and, regardless of how he might feel about either of these things, <em>you cannot access him</em>. As the writer Matthew Crawford says, “it&#8217;s this sense that there&#8217;s no one you can grab hold of by the lapels and hold to account…. that&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the definition of tyranny: power that is not accountable…and is not operating with your best interests at heart”.<a href="#sdendnote8sym"><sup>viii</sup></a></p>



<p>You can complain at your local Zara shop, write a post on Instagram, even post the faulty garment back in protest- but are any of these tactics likely to raise production and material standards at Zara? A local clothing economy has to, and wants to, produce high quality clothing – it is essential to its survival, justifying the necessary higher price points. Furthermore, making things well is fundamental to the philosophy shared by most people who make their own products. By making things that last and being locally accessible to offer repairs, a locally made clothing economy reduces waste, builds relationships and restores customer respect and appreciation for ‘a job well done’; no global brand can offer this.</p>



<p>But what about those who cannot afford to participate in a locally made clothing economy? The reality is that locally made clothing cannot and should not compete with the likes of Primark and BooHoo – in rebuilding a locally made industry, we do not want to copy the environmental or human exploitation of the global fashion industry. This requires a shift in thinking about the numbers of new clothes we can purchase per year. For a lot of people, buying locally <em>is</em> possible but it will mean buying less. In the context of Scotland, this may not be possible for those on the lowest incomes, even to meet their basic practical clothing needs. The city of Glasgow has some of the highest levels of deprivation in Western Europe and, whilst secondhand clothing can play a part here, we know that there exists real, understandable stigmas and shame around wearing secondhand. We must acknowledge that and be hopeful that revitalising a local clothing economy will just be one part of revitalising cities more broadly, and that by investing in the local makers, more jobs and better outcomes will be generated for the wider population. This is not ‘trickle-down’ economics as we have witnessed it, which in the words of Jason Hickel has been ‘barely even a vapour’<a href="#sdendnote9sym"><sup>ix</sup></a>, this is local investment with local beneficiaries. The fact that people cannot afford to buy a locally made £17 t-shirt (versus a £2 equivalent at Primark) is an indicator of poverty caused by an economy that needs to be urgently addressed politically, not through independent makers being paid less.</p>



<p>In the transition to a thriving local clothing economy, it is important that a broad range of tastes are catered for by local makers – for real change, this cannot be something solely for the sustainability-conscious middle classes. We need to bring along as many people as possible and everybody needs to feel welcome on the journey. One way to do this would be to reinstate local business in the heart of city centres. Why shouldn’t a visit to Glasgow’s famous ‘style mile’ on Buchanan Street bring you into contact with local fashion brands, tailors and dressmakers? Why has it become the norm that this territory belongs to global brands and conglomerates only? Brands who are happy to remove themselves when the going-gets-tough, leaving unemployment and desolate department stores behind them. These cities, these spaces, do not belong to global brands – they belong to us, the citizens.</p>



<p>At the beginning of this article I asked you to imagine <em>a</em> city, now I want you to imagine <em>your</em> city (or closest city, wherever that might be). Imagine all the shops, vacated through lockdown and recession, now populated with a diverse range of local makers. Imagine walking past a window, previously boarded up, lit bright and displaying a garment that was carefully made and <em>made there</em> – you may even be able to see the designer at work towards the back of the shop. Imagine a long-ignored, faded department store, re-painted and re-populated with local businesses. Imagine visiting other cities and discovering that city’s local talent and unique fashion scene – not a carbon copy of global brand after global brand. If local authorities and government wanted to make this happen, they absolutely could, they could certainly make a start &#8211; it just takes the will, and a bit of imagination.</p>

<p><strong>Poem by Juana Adcock. Illustration: Fadzai Mwakutuya; photo: Ewan Bush</strong></p>



<p>This is from #2 of LESS &#8211; our journal of degrowth, radical sufficiency and decolonisation in Scotland. <a href="https://www.enough.scot/less/">Details of how to get a print copy here.</a></p>



<p></p>



<p><em><u>Steel</u></em></p>



<p>I place my palm en la reja called border wall.</p>



<p>Let its steel enter my body: iron alloyed with carbon</p>



<p>hardened to prevent the<em> movement of</em> <em>dislocations.</em></p>



<p>I am in Tijuana, looking at California through the bars</p>



<p>though it isn’t clear where the prison lies.</p>



<p>To my left the bars peter out into an ocean</p>



<p>whose waves refuse to be contained.</p>



<p>The body of an adult human</p>



<p>contains about four grams of iron;</p>



<p>all four of mine rush to meet la reja imantada.</p>



<p>When we speak of magnetism,</p>



<p>we think of love, or charisma,</p>



<p>or crowds of faces all in one direction.</p>



<p>But never of iron as the metal</p>



<p>at the active site of many enzymes</p>



<p>dealing with cellular respiration</p>



<p>or the pull towards a ‘better life’.</p>



<p>Glasgow’s sandstone tenements, incidentally,</p>



<p>are red because they contain iron.</p>



<p>Our blood stone is iron ore.</p>



<p>It emanates its own light.</p>



<p>We are the blood, migrating</p>



<p>bringing cargo</p>



<p>from one cell to the next</p>



<p>keeping the body alive, we transport</p>



<p>mercancía</p>



<p>maquinaria</p>



<p>manos</p>



<p>más.</p>



<p>The iron for the wall was mined in the M states</p>



<p>bordering with Canada.</p>



<p>Not that long ago, the land was cleared</p>



<p>of its people, wildlife and forests.</p>



<p>Migrants from Europe fed the logs down the rivers</p>



<p>laid the train tracks</p>



<p>peeled away life on the topsoil</p>



<p>bloodlet the earth to build</p>



<p>this line of steel</p>



<p>marking the limits of possession.</p>



<p>Praying from Carnegie’s <em>Gospel of Wealth</em></p>



<p>which built an empire of steel</p>



<p>repeating that this was progress</p>



<p>away from universal squalor</p>



<p>we were able to steal our eyes away</p>



<p>from the impoverishment</p>



<p>of the lands</p>



<p>—now empty red pits</p>



<p>gaping red wounds</p>



<p>as far as the eye can see.</p>



<p></p>



<p><em><u>The Letter M</u></em></p>



<p>With a guru’s moustache and a penchant for conspiracy</p>



<p>the madman explains to me that language is a form of mind control</p>



<p>the grammar itself holding us in a bind</p>



<p>– an incantation muttered over millenia</p>



<p>shaping our thoughts.</p>



<p>I want to master the art of the pictogram, he says.</p>



<p>It is the earliest form of writing</p>



<p>is uncontaminated by the misers, the drive for accumulation</p>



<p>created with the rise of agriculture.</p>



<p>The letter M, for example, is the pictogram of a wave</p>



<p>we forget where it comes from, it loses all meaning</p>



<p>we write it over and over without ever thinking of water</p>



<p>or how maritime and motherly,</p>



<p>muro y morada are of one essence.</p>



<p>As he speaks, I watch the surfers glide along the lip of the perfect breakers</p>



<p>almost for the whole line of the horizon</p>



<p>before they topple over into the sea</p>



<p>like tiny plastic soldiers.</p>



<p>That night we slept hearing the waves crash onto the rocks</p>



<p>and in the morning, we knew we were rocks too.</p>



<p>Our hearts, hardened lava.</p>



<p>The Pacific had smoothed round windows through us</p>



<p>and like a Barbara Hepworth sculpture</p>



<p>we were made whole</p>



<p>by what we lack.</p>



<p></p>



<p><em><u>Storylines</u></em></p>



<p>Roads are heavier on the rich side of the line.</p>



<p>Asphalt mixed with cement is whiter</p>



<p>loudening under car wheels, it hardens over time,</p>



<p>requiring little maintenance.</p>



<p>Such are the roads of the first world.</p>



<p>But the dwellings there are transient</p>



<p>wooden-framed and lighter</p>



<p>as if to be filled with</p>



<p>cushions and the crinkle of food wrappers</p>



<p>and some child’s quiet voice in a corner of the room</p>



<p>mouthing</p>



<p>and I’ll huff</p>



<p>and I’ll puff.</p>



<p>On the other side of the line</p>



<p>the asphalt grows crocodile-skinned.</p>



<p>Pockmarked and permeable,</p>



<p>it can cope with earthquakes</p>



<p>and melt in the sun.</p>



<p>Initially it’s cheaper to lay</p>



<p>but has a shorter lifespan.</p>



<p>Such the roads of the third world.</p>



<p>But here, our houses</p>



<p>you can tell by just looking at them</p>



<p>are made of cement, heavy as pyramids</p>



<p>as if to hold us at home</p>



<p>for longer.</p>



<p></p>

<p><em>Scotland is a country facing challenges while heading for several transitions simultaneously, but also blessed by opportunities. Working to realise them is urgent to make Scotland future-proof – a green country with a clean economy and solidarity society. Transforming the economy by physical degrowth would be active work towards independence, first within the political restrictions of the UK, then possibly with extended competences in devolution (usually the offer to buy off independence votes), and finally in an independent state. Political independence might even come too early if the journey towards degrowth and sufficiency has not made sufficient progress by that date.</em><strong> </strong></p>



<p>By Joachim Spangenberg. Vice President, Sustainable Europe Research Institute | Scientific Committee Chair, BUND/Friends of The Earth Germany</p>



<p>This is from #2 of LESS &#8211; our journal of degrowth, radical sufficiency and decolonisation in Scotland. <a href="https://www.enough.scot/less/">Details of how to get a print copy here.</a></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Independence? Which independence?</strong></p>



<p>If the majority of Scottish citizens will support independence, in a democratic country, the way forward would be obvious. Or is it?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s first scrutinise what “independence”, this totemic catchword, really means, and then have a look at processes, strategies and results. Totems symbolise important desires, but rarely give the full picture as believers in “sovereignty” south of the Scottish border are just realising.</p>



<p>First of all, independence is neither a state nor an act, but a process, as the fuK (formerly united Kingdom) is just experiencing; it comprises at least cultural, economic and political independence plus an established independent reputation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cultural independence without political independence is only possible with a high degree of autonomy, while the UK is probably the most centralised state in Western and Central Europe (an achievement given the competition of France, Spain, Poland and Hungary). It requires respecting mutually diverging preferences and not imposing those of one side upon the other, an option evaporated at the latest since the Westminster government decision to leave the EU and take Scotland (unlike Northern Ireland) with it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So the call for political independence is plausible, but not enough: political independence without economic independence is but a chimera, and how difficult it can be to gain that status is something the UK government is just learning on the fly (to avoid misunderstandings, economic independence does not imply a strive for autarky, but trade between independent states with their own national economies, not of one state with its appendix). An established independent reputation requires a distinguishable profile in all three dimensions, and targeted action and communication for its establishment.</p>



<p><strong>Cultural independence</strong></p>



<p>Regarding the cultural independence, Scotland has gained its own profile as a rather normal northern European nation with an inclination for social justice, a green (and blue) environment, participatory democracy and a functioning welfare state. Productivity is as high as in England, the population is well educated, and many universities are world-beating. However, it is suffering a bit from its political environment, a Little England nation which is an extreme outlier compared to the rest of Europe. In England, neoliberal attitudes are running deep (according to a Kings College London study, about half of the Britons – 84% of them English – blame people becoming unemployed in the COVID crisis that losing their job was their own fault: The Guardian, Feb. 25<sup>th</sup>, 2021). This attitude has been propagated and exploited by an undemocratic and increasingly illiberal, cronyism driven political-economic system on top of a weak and shrinking industrial base (accelerated by Brexit) and a dominating financial industry mainly located in London. Unfortunately, there have been some spill-overs into Scotland, partly enforced by UK law, but also partly adopted by mainstream politics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, as a result of UK politics, local communities have been suffering from austerity like communities across the UK, and have been transformed geographically and functionally through the introduction of the new public management in 1975.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the higher education system, Scotland does not only host the best university in the UK, but also many of its more fragile and most commercialised ones. In both economic cases the effective provision of public services – higher education is an almost cost-free service in most European countries – are hampered by budget constraints.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The neoliberal obsession with economic growth prevents rational analysis of needs, and undermines key environmental and social policy requirements. Fortunately for Scotland, some of its traditions also in these fields have deep roots and high resilience – its local jurisdiction, for example, reaching back 700 years, and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities some 500 years, with 1975 marking the transition of local authorities from a model resembling European traditions to the New Public Management approach preferred in the Anglosphere since the Thatcher and Reagan times.</p>



<p><strong>Political independence</strong></p>



<p>So while a political <em>divorce</em> may be as long away as Mr. Johnson stays his course, there is some repair work to be done in the Scottish society and its institutional structures. Dismantling (part of) the Wheatley reforms, complementing the reminder with a maximum of local citizen participation would overcome an important legacy of Thatcherite times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other elements – constrained by resources for the time being, but groundwork is possible – would be doing whatever is possible to restore the public services slashed under austerity, in particular at the local level, including functioning, decentralised health care system. Or take the higher education: if it is considered not a market good but a public good, it should be as freely accessible as the NHS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Have in mind that the classification of goods, whether as public, meritocratic, common pool or private market goods is a societal decision, and independence includes rethinking the current patterns, based on Scottish values and preferences. Strengthening local authorities would also release civil society from a major burden and permit focussing its energies more on the future than on plastering over the cracks of a broken system: as admirable as the efforts of NGOs and charities are, it is a shame that they have to substitute for lacking public services instead of offering innovation and added value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of this implies that winning a referendum is not the only strategy to pursue independence – it may even be more important to do the basic preparations now which would permit, once self-determination over the tax income has been achieved, to build new and better. Admittedly, it is a bit like refurbishing a ship while sailing it – but better to do it before the storms resulting from the divorce will sink the boat. However, redesigning governance and institutions, under the limitations prevailing, requires fresh thinking and public discourses regarding societal preferences and social practices. The symptoms of aspects of English conservatism cannot be overcome – not even after political independence – if the Scottish government still feels bound to neoliberal politics of deregulation, free markets and balanced budgets. The tide has turned in Europe in this respect (witness the European Green Deal and the growing discussions about Degrowth or the role of the state): the SNP should rethink what is an appropriate economic policy perspective for Scotland, in particular when the scheduled path leads back into the EU.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>With degrowth and sufficiency from problem-causing to problem-solving policies</strong></p>



<p>According to the recent study of the London School of Economics, leaving the UK would be twice to thrice as expensive for Scotland as having been taken out of the EU via Brexit. However, such figures are always based on assumptions, and in this case the assumption is a rather unchanged economic structure and policy, and continued economic dependence on England. However, if these assumptions are changed, the result will be different. I here argue that a sustainable transformation of the economy, significantly reducing its resource consumption, i.e. with physical degrowth, can be a game changer for a transition towards both sustainability and economic independence.</p>



<p>So what does ‘physical degrowth’ mean?&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is generally known that fossil fuel consumption drives the climate crisis, land use change drives biodiversity loss in particular in agricultural areas, and material flows destroy landscape and habitats while underpinning climate and biodiversity problems. Hence without a significant reduction of the environmental pressures from resource consumption, it will neither be possible to reach the UN Sustainable Development Goals, nor to guard the natural assets making up for a significant part of the wealth of Scotland. Current policies, however, are not dedicated to safeguarding assets, but to liquidate the stocks of natural wealth as only the sales but not the stocks count for the GDP, and GDP growth is the fetish of (neo)liberal policies. Consequently, degrowth is not about decreasing the GDP but rejects this fetish. Instead degrowth aims at reducing resource consumption to enable people to “living well within planetary boundaries” (Jonathon Porritt) or “living well, within the limits of our planet” (the EU 2050 target). This requires to complement the decarbonisation of the energy system with a dematerialisation of production and consumption, and efficiency with sufficiency.</p>



<p>As this may appear as if explaining one dubious new term by using other, just as dubious ones, let me give another round of explanations. While efficiency is well known as ‘making more output from the same input’ (hardly ever ‘using less input for the same output’, a way to describe dematerialisation), sufficiency policy can be defined as ‘enough for every need’. This implies that neither insufficient resource access like energy poverty, nor the squandering of resources beyond human needs is accepted. While human needs are limited, what is infinite is the number of potential satisfiers for these needs. Sufficiency is then to find resource light satisfiers for human needs, many of which will be communication, social bounds and other social processes, rather than market goods. And even the definition of good consumer goods and their value would change: if an industrial quality vacuum cleaner survives 20 times as many uses as a household cleaner, but costs twice as much, the equipment cost per use decreases by 90%. Cars are essentially not auto<em>mobiles</em> but auto<em>stabiles</em>, standing uselessly around and occupying public space between 22 and 23 ½ hours per day; over a lifetime of 12 years they are used 3 months to 1 year. Sharing could increase the daily use time from one to ten hours, driving the cost of cars per km down 80% even if a doubling of prices for better quality is assumed. Significant reductions in resource consumption (and sales, and hence GDP) would occur without any decrease in services enjoyed. Of course, such a transformation would require creating new decent employment opportunities for idle production workers in the reproduction sector of care, maintenance and repair. The higher price of better quality goods is an opportunity for the Scottish banking sector to come forward with loan and credit schemes which finance the extra cost with payback coming from the subsequent savings.</p>



<p>Degrowth and sufficiency would restructure input and output, supply and demand, reducing resource consumption and hence import needs, and moderate the export volumes required for a balanced trade. Currently about 2/3 of all Scottish imports come from the rest of the UK, and 60% of its exports go there – degrowth and sufficiency would change that. Regarding imports, the collapse and subsequent re-establishment of supply chains in the Corona crisis, and following Brexit, has shown that import restructuring is indeed possible, while some more proximate production in regional clusters is helpful for enhanced resilience. Finding new export markets is not as serious a challenge as the LSE assumed, as products for sustainable consumption are new and meet the demands of growing consumer groups; they are also in line with the recent developments of EU law to make repairability of a range of consumer goods and the extended availability of spare parts mandatory. These are but first steps of ‘Turning the Trends Together’, as the 8<sup>th</sup> EU Environmental Action Programme is titled.</p>



<p><strong>Economic independence: minimising risks&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Independence needs to change Scotland’s dependence on England’s economy. This implies that structural change, happening anyway all over the world, must be given a direction supporting both sustainability and enhanced economic independence.</p>



<p>To make an independent Scotland truly independent, it must gain economic self-determination as well – which of course would not be a splendid isolation from the outside world, no ‘Scotland first’ as some opponents might assert; the dedication to join the Single Market again demonstrates how nonsensical such suspicions are. But is should have its own industrial policy and development, and beyond fishing, tourism and whisky an economic portfolio which is attractive to EU partners, oriented towards the 2050 EU vision of the 7<sup>th</sup> Environmental Action Programme (7<sup>th</sup> EAP) titled ‘Living well, within the limits of our planet’, motivated by the 8<sup>th</sup> EAP ‘Turning the Trends Together’ and in compliance with the European Green Deal.</p>



<p>Both tasks are deeply intertwined. A big income source of the past has been the oil industry, which is in decline since the beginning of the century and must be phased out by 2050 in a climate neutral EU – 2040 would be a better target line from a climate policy perspective. This means that not only a significant number of jobs will be lost in that sector, but it is very well paid jobs – something to have in mind when looking for substitutes.</p>



<p>This is also the challenge when jobs in the financial industry sector are lost. Although having been shrinking significantly in the last decade, and although in Scotland financial services have a lower share of GDP than for the UK as a whole,<em> </em>the sector is still outsized for Scotland’s own economy, and a risk for its economic resilience. By 2020, Edinburgh was ranked 17th in the world for its financial services sector, and 6th in Western Europe, according to the Global Financial Services Centres Index, with more than 80,000 professionals employed directly by Scottish financial services industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Throughout history, the financial sector has been an assertion of national identity, a source of some pride and a bulwark for the Scottish economy against being run from London. However, since 1979, management of the UK economy (including Scotland) has followed a broadly laissez-faire approach, including the financial sector and the Bank of England as Scotland’s central bank. The thrive for deregulation the economy, including the banking sector, was one of the reasons for the financial crisis starting 2008 – Adam Smith, having experienced the 1772 banking crash in Edinburgh, had warned not to include banking into the deregulation processes he favoured. In a currency union with the rest of the UK, the Bank of England would remain the lender of last resort (an option the Tories reject) – but an independent Scotland would have to turn to the Bank of England and the Treasury to protect its savers. In the longer turn, despite its strength in fintech and multiple start-ups, an oversized and vibrant financial industry is a risk as much as an asset, and to become rather dull and conservative again would safeguard the Scottish economy against the risks of volatile financial markets Hence a capable central bank acting in line with Scottish interests is required to avoid threats to the national budget. Let the banks move their headquarters, their top management and with it the risks and responsibilities – but keep the back offices jobs in Scotland where rents are a little more than half the price of London, and qualified personnel is abundant. However, that implies a new strategy: not growth of volume and risks, but degrowth of the sector.</p>



<p>Finally, there is another sector to be mentioned which is hardly compatible with a sustainable, environmentally benign future development: mining and quarrying. Globally mining is one of the most destructive industries, causing massive energy consumption, material flows and biodiversity loss. Scottish industrial policy should aim at phasing out such dinosaurs as mining zinc, and minerals, even if that due to their local economic importance may require targeted measures to provide alternatives.</p>



<p>As the English navy will not have its ships built in an independent Scotland, Glasgow as the hub of the UK&#8217;s shipbuilding industry must look out for new niches (anyway, the Westminster U-turn to increasing the stock of nuclear missiles and placing them in Scotland is a toxic gift). Fortunately, there are alternatives: take for instance ship recycling which is so far mostly done under horrible environmental and working conditions in South Asia. It could turn into a clean source of employment and resources for the industry, in particular when ‘ships’ includes the oil platforms and installations being dismantled and recycled when the North Sea oil production is phased out, and the offshore wind and wave power installations when they meet their time.</p>



<p><strong>Economic independence: seizing opportunities</strong></p>



<p>Europe is undergoing massive societal and industrial change, with the European Green Deal just the tip of the iceberg (a large tip, admittedly). A European Scotland must be prepared to re-enter a changed community, and for the role to play within it. Striving for economic independence for Scotland implies pursuing a productive, resilient and fairer economic model, delivering long-term sustainability and economic opportunity for all. Fortunately, the prevailing structure of the Scottish industry offers a variety of opportunities for this, and for playing an important role in a changing Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scotland was one of the industrial powerhouses of Europe from the time of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Industrial Revolution</a> onwards. This left a legacy in the diversity of goods and services which Scotland produces, from traditional ones like textiles and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisky" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whisky</a> to jet engines, buses and ships, computer software and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microelectronics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">microelectronics</a>, as well as banking, insurance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_management" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investment management</a> and other related financial services. This history, if modernised, offers opportunities for the future (but the ‘modernised’ is crucial – think of the huge tracks of land for hunting and shooting for a tiny percentage of people, often at the expense of Scottish biodiversity). For instance, the food industry sector is a quality producer, and with the EU “Farm to Fork” strategy, the Chemical Strategy and the Zero Pollution Strategy aiming at reducing pesticide use and toxicity by half in the next decade, moving to sustainable farming now, or even already being doing so, is a clear first mover advantage. This is an opportunity to reduce inputs, a physical degrowth, which need not imply economic losses due to quality premiums consumers are ready to pay. Scotland already has a vibrant food industry, and home-made brands which have – or could have – European and international appeal. The sustainable production of beef and mutton with grazing rather than agro-industrial mass production generates premium products and is not only well-suited to the Scottish landscape, but also caters for health food trends all over Europe (the still neo-feudalistic land ownership structure may require further measures than the competencies given to local authorities half a decade ago, also to enhance reforestation where appropriate instead of wood export). Refraining from importing protein-rich feedstock is not only good for the nutrient balance of national lands and rivers, but is also a significant contribution to future-proofing the system by dematerialising it. Agriculture may be of minor importance for the Scottish GDP (about 2%), but it affects ¾ of Scotland’s landscape and thus its biodiversity, making it a crucial sector for a sustainable Scotland. Other high quality food, from salmon and other smoked fish to cheese and fruit contribute to the domestic quality of life, but are also promising export goods – already the food industry earns more revenues than oil, and the Scottish smoked salmon industry is worth more than all of the UK fishing industry. Whisky is probably the best known of Scotland&#8217;s manufactured products. Despite international competition (now even from English whisky) production soars with new distilleries coming to the market, supporting about 35,000 jobs. Exports have continuously increased, and Scotch whisky is now one of the UK&#8217;s overall top five manufacturing export earners. As a dedicated Scotch malt whisky enthusiast, this is the one sector I personally consider degrowth undesirable…&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fisheries is another traditional sector of low economic but high cultural and social importance, at least in coastal areas. The waters surrounding Scotland are some of the richest in Europe; however in the last decade permanent overfishing has led to historically low abundances of commercially valuable fish in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sea" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North Sea</a> and parts of the North Atlantic, although cod is now relocating from English to Scottish waters due to climate change. European fishing ministers are to blame for much of that loss as they have set quota continuously higher than the maximum sustainable ones determined by science – here the only potential for positive impact from Brexit, significantly reducing the overall quota to let the fish stocks recover, has been spoiled by Westminster. Britain has two specific problems with fishing quota the UK government does not address, failures the Scottish government should emphasize and push to revert as soon as possible, independent or not yet. One is that free-market Britain, unlike others, let fishers sell their quotas abroad. In 2018 the Dutch ship Cornelis Vrolijk, registered in Caterham, owned 23% of the entire UK quota – not an issue caused by the Fisheries Policy, but a property deal. The other one is that in Britain, 77% of the boats are less than 10 metres long, employing most of the UK’s 12,000 fishers, yet owning just 4% of local quota. The British government could have changed that, redistributing quotas between British big ships and small boats. Such a change was even advocated by the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy which called for including “social, economic and environmental criteria” in quota allocation, but it was not implemented in Britain. As small boats matter most for coastal life and do least environmental harm, they should take priority, with quota taken from the big boats and given to the under-10 m flotilla – a measure to degrow the fishing industry in a socially and environmentally sustainable way. Besides reducing catches, to let stocks recover, scaling down is advisable: banning large swimming fish factories, banning dredging and other unsustainable forms of fisheries. Most of this would be possible under the current legal situation – the villain sits in Westminster, not in Brussels, and should be exposed to more pressure to address the real reasons of small-fishers’ problems.</p>



<p>Like in all industrialised economies, over the last 40 years both manufacturing and extractive industries have been losing importance. This applies for instance to the textile industry, which surprisingly is still a major employer in Scotland, with a workforce of more than 20,000. Here again the key to survival besides modern production technology, qualified jobs and good work is occupying a niche in the high quality sector – producing not more but continuing to earn a decent income from the high end of the textile market is a strategy in line with past efforts. Not growth of volume (fast fashion), but of quality is a future-proof option. However, in this sector as well it should be accompanied by branding, maybe stimulated and coordinated by the Scottish government, making ‘Scottish quality’ a household name all over Europe and beyond.</p>



<p>One of the growing economic sectors in Scotland is the services sector (including hospitality), representing already ¾ of the Scottish economy. From a sustainability point of view, this is a positive trend, as the energy and resource intensity in services is lower than in the average industry (but less than many suspect as services depend on material and energy intensive infrastructures). The open question is the way services are provided: by profit-oriented companies, by the state or by the third sector of local initiatives and not-for-profit businesses? In a country with less dense population and only few big cities, the latter appears to be the most effective way to bring services directly to the people – again a question of appropriate structuring of local administrations, and of providing them with the financial means to do so, e.g. by local taxes for local services.</p>



<p>Part of the services industry is tourism. While battered by the COVID crisis and in urgent need of recovery (like many of the hospitality businesses for domestic enjoyment), tourism is a double edged sword. Witness the anti-tourism sentiments and campaigns in Venice or Barcelona, and tipping points become obvious, with tourism going from a blessing to a nightmare when crossing them. Arguably, the “disneyfication” of Scotland’s capital city has reached and occasionally crossed that threshold, with disneyfication meaning to take culturally significant stories, trivialising and marketing them, depriving them of meaning for increased profit. Beyond Edinburgh, hiking in the Highlands would be less of an enjoyment in an overcrowded landscape, and the Ring of Brodgar as overcrowded as Stonehenge would be a nightmare. So sure there is an opportunity for growth in tourism, in certain places and at certain times, but it should be focussed on sustainable, culturally embedded tourism, and it has its limits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most modern sector, and rather unknown to European customers, is the IT and high tech industry – who knows how large a share of tablets, laptops and equipment bought in Europe comes from Scotland? High quality research, not only in Edinburgh, and multiple spin-offs promise solid economic prospects in the digital age. However, given the limitations of resource supply, the escalating energy demand of the IT infrastructure, and the need for digital sufficiency, many of the growth prognoses appear overblown. Again most promising are market niches – for instance, the idea of the circular economy, now central to the EU’s industrial policy, has not really penetrated the hard- and software industry, while in the field of energy saving incremental progress has been made but disruptive new ideas are lacking. Such concepts could reconcile physical degrowth, zero carbon targets, and good work in a profitable industrial sector. Will Scotland offer solutions?</p>



<p>Finally, there is the energy sector, probably the most promising one despite the transformation it is undergoing. While oil and gas will be phased out rather soon, they will in many applications – while having the structural change in mind – be replaced by electricity from renewable sources. Scotland’s continental shelf area, where the sea is shallow enough to build sea-floor anchored wind energy installations is huge, and the wind is strong and quasi-permanent. Scotland could provide a quarter of the EU’s off-shore wind electricity production, and a comparably reliable part of it. Beyond the continental shelf, sea floor based wind turbines cannot be built; wind energy farms would have to be floating – and Scotland hosts the world’s biggest floating offshore wind farm, the 50MW Kincardine installation. Wave Energy Scotland, formed at the request of the Scottish Government, is a world leader in the development of marine energy – so who now rules the waves? Besides the up and down of waves, the coming and going of tides is another reliable and regular natural process which can be exploited for energy generation; one of the world’s oldest tidal energy power plants is located on Islay. Although in terms of direct solar energy, Scotland is not really privileged, by exploiting its indirect effects it has huge potential – given its onshore and offshore potentials, Scotland has the capability of becoming one of the biggest clean energy suppliers in the EU.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But being an electricity producer is not the end of the line – on the input side, green energy requires the mechanical work of building turbines and other installation, which is already a relevant sector of the Scottish economy. Extending the capabilities to producing, maintaining and recycling all these marine installations offers opportunities for a plethora of qualified and well-paid jobs. Add to this the up- and downstream potentials, and the effects can be enormous. Upstream, smart IT solutions are sought, and offer opportunities for start-ups and established firms, with personnel available from Scotland’s first class academic faculties. Downstream electricity is the basis of the emerging hydrogen and Power to Liquid (PtL) industries which supply their customers with renewable (“blue” or “green”) hydrogen, i.e. not based on processing methane or other fossil fuels. Hydrogen as such, or hydrogen-based synthetic fuels are one of the big hopes of the aviation and hauling sectors where some fossil fuel applications are otherwise hard to replace (probably less so for the private car market), and if produced locally and shipped by boat or pipeline, a significant share of the value added could remain in Scotland. This is all the more the case when basic chemicals produced by using “green hydrogen” are processes to higher value chemical products – an option for the Scottish chemicals industry to transform itself into a carbon-negative post-fossil industrial sector, in line with dematerialisation and sufficiency criteria.</p>



<p><strong>Anchoring Scotland in Europe</strong></p>



<p>As mentioned before, an independent country needs a distinct profile, a brand – ‘Scottish quality’ may be an example, communicating both identity and a dedication sounding attractive to potential customers. However, beyond a marketing and branding campaign to be initiated and supported by the Scottish government involving all sectors, there are more outreach measures Holyrood could consider for profiling. If there were Scottish cultural centres in major cities, offering music performances, fashion presentations by Scottish designers and art exhibitions of Scottish artists and museums, poets and writers, philosophers and scientists, but also cooking courses for Scottish cuisine, the profile would be diversified.</p>



<p>But as important for a lasting relation as presenting oneself frankly is understanding the other side, and that begins in education, in learning about history, philosophy, literature, arts, science, politics. For instance, history book chapters jointly authored by French and Scottish authors about the Napoléon wars, or by German, French, Russian and Scottish authors on the world wars would help put national narratives in a broader context. Similar efforts with others from former colonies would also be welcome. The same applies to philosophy: without knowing the difference between European consequentialism and Anglo-Saxon utilitarism it is hard to understand the different modes of governance, and without having read at least a bit of Dante, Cervantes and Schiller it will be difficult to understand the imaginaries motivating European citizens – who in turn should read Burns and Common Sense Philosophy. Reading such authors, but also the daily news works much better when understanding the language. In Switzerland or Luxemburg, three languages are mandatory, four usual, and three to four in Portugal. In Germany only two to three, sadly. Offering incentives to take language courses would be a great step, as would be a replacement for the Erasmus Programme with a more European focus than the Westminster suggestions. Such programmes are the launch platform for lasting private networks, complementing the institutional European networks with Scottish members, for cultural associations, consumer organisations (BEUC), professional organisation in all fields, trade unions (ETUC), environmentalists (e.g. European Environment Bureau, FoE Europe) and bird watchers (Birdlife Europe).&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the government level, there are non-regulatory European institutions which are not part of the EU apparatus and welcome non-EU members like the Dublin Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions run by employers and unions, or European Environment Agency EEA which has members from the EU, EFTA and the Balkan countries. Interestingly, the EEA is open to membership for all European countries, and as “country” is the legal state of Scotland, the EEA Scientific Committee has already encouraged Scotland to join the institution.</p>



<p><strong>PS</strong></p>



<p>In old friendship to Scotland’s southern neighbour, Scots might be willing to do the English a big favour by saying farewell: a UK having shrunk by a third would (hopefully) enable England to first time reflect on its own identity, its potentials and their limits, beyond imperial fantasies. It might be painful, but would be a healing process.</p>
