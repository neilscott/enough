										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><br> “During the industrial era people were forced to endure long and bitter conflicts in their struggle to participate in the political system…It remains to be seen whether the transformation of traditional industrial societies will be accompanied by a regress of democratic structures or whether progress towards more democracy is already culturally anchored and irreversible.” <br> <br> <strong><em>Information panel, Ruhr Museum, 2019</em></strong><br> <br>Never one to miss out on a seminal moment, in 1790 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe travelled to Upper Silesia, then on the fringes of the Prussian Empire – where he witnessed the first ‘fire-machines’ – or steam engines, to operate on the continent. </p>



<p>Goethe
penned a few lines of advice to his hosts on what was then an isolated
frontier, asking them: “Far from educated people, at the end of the empire, who
helps you, find treasures and bring them to light?.”</p>



<p>The
polymath’s answer was succinct: “only understanding and honesty help; the two
keys that lead to any treasure that the earth holds.” </p>



<p>For Goethe, rational humanism, technological progress – and the ever-greater task of getting riches out from underneath the earth – could be conceived of as a single project. </p>



<p>But
despite two long centuries in which traditions of empiricism and scientific
inquiry seemed to move in step with industrial expansion and growth – this deep
narrative that undergirded capitalist development has, in our time, arrived at an
abrupt end. </p>



<p>Its
end can be seen in the brave new world of carbon-nationalism – humming
dissonant old tunes that drown out concepts of the planetary or the universal.
It can be heard in the words of an Australian Prime Minister who watches vast
swathes of his country burn, but encourages fireworks displays through the
smog, “to express to the world just how optimistic and positive we are.”</p>



<p>Coal has become, in recent years, bound up with belief in carbon-as-saviour. This represents an argument with scientific method – in so far as national truths become incompatible with basic ideas that have shaped modern industrial societies. Rejecting complexity, this belief centres on the nation as the only whole collective body we can recognise: a place that has heartlands, where honest nationals once did tough honest work. </p>



<p>In
2015, when US senator Jim Inhofe brought a snowball to Capitol Hill for a
debate on climate change, he wasn’t simply arguing with a demonstrable reality,
he was asserting a belief in the nation as a greater, religious, truth. Just as
there are no sacrificial rituals dedicated to science, there is no planet in
the minds of these men – just one tribe under god. </p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p>In
Europe’s coalfields, from Upper Silesia by the waters of the Vistula, to South
Wales on the shores of the Atlantic – mining is seen as a vital old tradition; not
quite, but soon to be lost to history. Solidarity and the raw truth of this
work – with its dirt and its danger – are regional bedrocks of tradition. </p>



<p>But
coal is more present than it has ever been — both in terms of the amount of
carbon that now sits in the atmosphere, and in our continued dependence on a
world in which cheap fuel and cheap labour are the basic players in the global
economy. But coal is also very old. Too old, in fact, for many of us to
comprehend. </p>



<p>This
point is not lost on the curators of the Silesian Museum, which opened in 2015.
Sited on a former colliery – the glass façades of its spectacular new
structures are decorated with images painted by former miner Ludwik Holesz, in
1968.</p>



<p>Holesz’s
painting was inspired by a fossilised leaf imprinted on a piece of coal from
the Carboniferous period and his painting depicts the flora and fauna, compressed
through millennia, into the riches and energy that made Upper Silesia. </p>

<p>There’s
a humility to this work too, with its inquisitive-eyed creatures darting with
vivid colours from behind ferns. All of that colour and imagination, leaping
from out of a primordial darkness, speaks to the kind of perspective and
vitality required to place the significance of carbon in context. </p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p>From Upper Silesia I travel some 600 miles west, to another heartland: the Ruhr valley. I see familiar uniforms, part of a mining culture that followed Prussian expansion and bedded down in both regions. One small legacy of that state’s military and bureaucratic might – underpinned by coal itself. <br></p>



<p>The fire machines which so impressed Goethe in the 1790s brought in their wake vast movements of people. They would soon transform the regions where their power was put to use beyond recognition. </p>



<p>Steam
meant movement, a new animating force for the age. The race to industrialise,
and get all that cheap energy out of the ground, brought Germans to what is now
Poland, Poles to the shores of the Rhine, and many other peoples still. However
much the ensuing centuries might have refashioned the flags, borders and
ideologies that ruled above ground – underneath it, coal held sway – a magnetic
force for the uprooted masses. By the 1890s, the population of the Ruhr stood
at around two million, compared to three hundred thousand in 1850.</p>



<p>If you transform the land, it sets the masses in motion. This is a basic fact but one worth noting. Here’s another to sit beside it: half of all the industrial carbon emissions in our atmosphere date from 1988. This is not something that has to be explained to the Chinese farmer’s son working at Foxconn, but the tragic coincidence of our times is that the observable planetary condition is as present at it is distant and unknowable. These truths invite a shrug: anyway, who can really know a whole world? We are all anchored to some small patch of it – and it is the genius of carbon nationalism to convince people, in their hearts, that <em>they</em> don’t have to move, even as the flames scorch the fringes of the homestead.</p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p>There are few monuments to the awesome power of coal and steel as spectacular as the Zollverein Industrial complex – with its iconic double winding gear. Closed in 1986, it was once the most productive mine in the world, today its vast, strange, beauty has won UNESCO World Heritage designation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="768" height="1024" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ruhrsteps-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8150" srcset="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ruhrsteps-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ruhrsteps-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ruhrsteps-585x780.jpg 585w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ruhrsteps-1170x1560.jpg 1170w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ruhrsteps-100x133.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<p>Now housing a range of cultural facilities within its cavernous surroundings, the air around these Bauhaus-inspired structures is clearer than it once was. This is frequently remarked upon by visitors from across Germany, many of whom still view the Ruhr as a smoke-black region of incessant noise and movement. </p>



<p>My guide, Frank Switala, whose grandfather came to the Ruhr at the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, explains how this perception was grounded in reality. <br><br> “I remember days in my childhood, where everything was polluted by smoke: my grandma tested the wind in the evening and then she decided if she could leave the washing out or take it in.”</p>



<p>Frank, a child of the post-war boom years, also recalls that this moment of intensive industrial expansion saw the Ruhr became something of a cosmopolitan heartland – a necessity given German industry&#8217;s thirst for labour.</p>



<p>“When I was kid after school, you could just throw your ball in the back and whistle and get ten or twelve kids around you and that team was as international as Liverpool FC is today.”</p>



<p>My
guide is also eager to tell me about his travels to Wales during the miner’s
strike: “my personal impression at that moment when I was there I thought, hey,
this country&#8217;s close to civil war.”</p>



<p>He
contrasts this with the German state’s willingness to subsidise local coal at
the time: “what we did was we bought social peace.” </p>



<p>Part of that legacy is Zollverein itself. Near the entrance to the Ruhr Museum, within the complex’s former coal washing plant, is a lump of coal from the last shift at the last hard coal mine in Germany, closed in 2018. Visitors are then invited downwards into the depths of the region’s pre-history – via a glowing orange stairway inspired by molten steel that befits a passage to the underworld. </p>



<p>“I find this is one of the best examples for the transition going on. And we try to keep up with the future, because there&#8217;s one day that will be coming when coal mining is a long, long time gone.”<br><br>  “We&#8217;re still in transition. This is something that has not completed. Yes. 150 years of industrialization. You cannot undo it in one or two generations,” explains Frank. </p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p>Travelling
across Germany, &nbsp;it’s striking to consider
that the country that worships Goethe’s mix of enlightenment humanism and
romantic obsession with prelapsarian nature, is facing political crises and a
wider sense of angst about its future. The engine room of Europe’s economy is
on a collision course with the contradictions of growth and development, and
the consequences of great wealth on a volatile planet. To crib a theme from the
great man’s canon – looking back, it all seems a bit Faustian. </p>



<p>Cheap
coal underpinned social democracy and the wonders of post-war economic recovery
in West Germany. It also lies just under the surface of contemporary divisions
— in the poorer East, the country’s green credentials are all too easily
presented as just another urban fad — and the opportunistic nationalism of AFD
is happy to portray climate change as a hoax. Similarly, as a recent scandal
concerning a satirical song about a carbon guzzling grandmother shows, the
demographic strains occurring across an ageing populace, are part of the
picture too. </p>



<p>The Scott Morrisons and Jim Inhofes of this world would like our memories to be short, and our imaginative sense of history as narrow as a national anthem. Increasingly, carbon-nationalism pits the traditional idealised image of the miner against the migrant – forgetting that, so often, they have been one and the same. </p>



<p>But far from being bound up with tradition, much of that carbon is fresh – in 1988 the world produced 8.75 billion tonnes of carbon from coal, compared to 14.57 billion tonnes in 2017. <br><br>All those tonnes of raw energy were some 300 million years in the making. The great anxiety of all those absurd old men, preaching national optimism and holding up coal as the authentic saviour, is a desperate desire to avoid confronting our mortal, finite, condition. Because even in the current orgy of burning, coal reminds us, above all, of our own irrelevance. Something that every miner, mixing his sweat and breath to unsettle awesome geological forces on a day to day basis, learns as an apprentice. </p>

<p><strong>&#8220;Across the continent, millions do not recognize themselves in the climate movement.&#8221;</strong><br><br><strong>Green New Deal for Europe, </strong><em><strong>Blue Print for Europe’s Just Transition </strong></em></p>



<p><strong>&#8220;The consumer is essentially somebody who feels, or is made to feel, lost, unless he or she is consuming. Brand names and logos become the place-names of the Nowhere.&#8221;</strong><br><br><strong>John Berger, </strong><em><strong>Ten Dispatches about Place </strong></em></p>



<p>I take the slow train from Berlin to the Polish border in the early morning. On the platform of an eastern suburban station, tired workers wearing puffer jackets and carrying sports bags smoke and chat in quick snatches of mother-tongue — cheerful at the flashes of recognition. We move through a deep mist settled over plains and forests, and then cross a river. On the other side, another train south, that began its journey at the Baltic sea, speeds along with its cargo segmented in the old fashioned six-person compartments. Everyone who enters is obligated to offer a greeting, and bids farewell to everyone else, having shared this warm space for a stretch. They don’t share much detail about what their journeys are for or where they terminate. </p>



<p>I see forests and small hamlets, some of which we stop at. The great smokestacks of coal-fired power, painted in the national colours of red and white, are one of the few notable reminders that a border has been crossed. The raw variety of capitalism that re-shaped Poland after everything changed 30 years ago, and which is now challenged in turn by a winning mix of nationalism, welfarism and social conservatism, dispensed with old-fashioned loyalties to place. Yet people have shifted to-and-fro here for centuries, and perhaps the outflow of workers to the glittering cluster cities westward from Berlin was inevitable. As inevitable as the ten-hour train home, punctuated by excited calls from relatives, the boredom in anticipation, the slumber needed but not to be achieved — the glittering corporate logos triumphant over Berlin Ostbahnhof, still imprinted on heavy eyelids.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>The rolling stock is probably not that much older than I am – like the post-Communist world, coming to terms with moving into its thirties. Yet, not for the first time, I’m reminded as we power along this fully-electrified line, of the peculiar British backwardness about such things. If this rolling stock originates in the Warsaw Pact era, it’s sobering to recall that much of Britain’s rail infrastructure is essentially still Victorian. </p>



<p>Our island is an island, stuck in its ways. Even if, as measured by the dead metric of growth, it outstrips many of these places, it reproduces itself on a loop. The modernity of Britain is absurd and excitable: simply the spectacle of property and wealth rising beyond the grasp of those who traipse above and underground. Modernity in Europe feels older, wrinkled and cranky, like an old barfly. It has lived through a lot more, if we’re honest. The full employment of Communism and its necessary equivalent in the relative comfort of the western social democracies are gone, but the sight of its worn form still lingering reminds those raised in Britain of the social solidarity that we never <em>really </em>had. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>A
few days later, in Katowice, I realise that the taste and smell of coal in a
large industrialised European city isn’t the only feature that makes the past
feel particularly present. </p>



<p>In this city —&nbsp; think of a coal cottonoplis — winding gear, some of which towers over pits still in use, can be seen across the horizon. 80% of Poland’s electricity still comes from coal, with much of it still hauled from below ground by the state-backed firm PGG. Around Katowice they dig hard coal: the good stuff. </p>



<p>At dawn the next morning I see miners in smart black uniforms and plumed caps wake up the residents of the model mining village Nikiszowiec with their brass band. They represent the opposite of the world of Poland post-EU accession, with its migration of millions of Poles abroad in search of work. Their music beats the bounds of the place they have made through their labours. It is the beginning of <em>Barbórka —</em> the feast day of St Barbara — the patron saint of all those who work in trades likely to be suddenly lethal – but here particularly venerated by miners. </p>



<p>The
getting of coal in Poland has long been fundamental to the national story.</p>



<p>There are no illusions here that this bedrock of history can simply be shrugged off. Although hundreds of thousands have left the industry in recent years, mining is still a major employer. But perhaps the way coal has knitted itself into the cultural fabric of Upper Silesia will be more significant in the longer term. Although for many years a debatable territory where the former domains of the great imperial houses of Europe converged — this is also a Polish heartland and coal is fundamental to what that modern nation became. </p>



<p>The miners were embraced by Communist leaders as a model for Soviet-inspired productivism. Edward Gierek, first secretary of the ruling Polish United Workers&#8217; Party throughout the 1970s, told them: “We will always be honoured to award miners for their effort and contribution to the development of our socialist homeland.”</p>



<p>But
despite their relatively privileged place in the system, miners also played a
seminal role in resistance to the authorities Gierek oversaw. Later, I visit
the weighty monument to nine miners killed at the Wujek colliery in 1981, during
a protracted period of strikes and occupations sparked by the regime’s
imposition of martial law, as living standards plummeted.</p>



<p>The bloody confrontation at Wujek was a pivotal moment in Poland’s transition from Communism, showing the significance of Solidarność&#8217;s actions a year after the Gdańsk Agreement. This use of state violence underlined the moral cause of the trade union&#8217;s protracted fight for national liberation, which, despite many compromises, achieved the unprecedented by establishing an autonomous trade union within a totalitarian system. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Across decades of enormous change — as regimes of different ideological and national stripes came and went in Upper Silesia – the heroic figure of the miner has remained a constant. Within this context, the Polish state’s recent opt-out from the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EU Commission’s Green Deal</a> is unsurprising, as is the minimal interest from miners themselves in talking about transition. Since Katowice hosted COP24 last year, many journalists from Western Europe have traipsed here seeking authentic characters agreeable to a rapid shift away from coal. But there is no shortage of people keen to talk about the difficult lived reality of life in a major coal-producing region. Citizens of small towns like Imielin tell me that they are threatened by a very literal undermining: as PGG seeks to expand mining operations a few hundred metres below their homes. The region also has some of the worst air quality on the continent. </p>



<p>This situation speaks to the questions at the forefront of my journey. How could a carbon transition keep hold of the legacy of democratic and social struggles that placed miners, with their unique role in society, in the vanguard? Could a radical Green New Deal re-establish the old proud loyalty to place: that desire for rootedness and community that the global market has robbed from so many? </p>



<p>The disparities around energy use across different EU regions demonstrates, on a more comprehensible scale, the great unspeakable blasphemy that haunts all talk of transition globally — the notion that growth and prosperity might not be part of the bargain. The idea that places where the missionaries of consumerism are still penetrating should not enjoy its promise, because they heard the gospel too late, makes a mockery of what many consider just. It’s easier to casually come to the view that everyone on the planet should forego a new washing machine, if your grandparents weren’t beaten and imprisoned for daring to object to the fact that no amount of toil would procure basic commodities. </p>



<p>There are three scraps of solace that we can take from this situation. Firstly, as has been shown by the way that people in the global south respond to catastrophic climate events, those with less often retain more resilient community networks — in contrast, high death tolls from heatwaves in Western Europe have been partly attributed to the fact that many elderly people live alone. Secondly, the unconventional history of Solidarność shows that class struggle does not have to follow a pre-ordained path. If working-class collective action can help topple one contradictory ideology, it can do so again. Finally, the way in which the region embraces the cultural significance of coal has a rich symbolic of power. Unlike the UK, they don’t simply want to forget all the dirt and blood bound up in the creation of energy systems &#8211; the focus of the next instalment documenting my journey. </p>

<p>‘…<em><strong>in the era of global warming, nothing is really far away; there is no place where the orderly expectations of bourgeois life hold unchallenged sway.’</strong></em></p>



<p><em><strong>Amitav Ghosh, The Great Derangement: Climate Change and the Unthinkable  <br> </strong></em></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/coal-1626368_960_720.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8004" width="600" srcset="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/coal-1626368_960_720.jpg 960w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/coal-1626368_960_720-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/coal-1626368_960_720-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/coal-1626368_960_720-585x439.jpg 585w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/coal-1626368_960_720-100x75.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></figure></div>



<p>Setting out at a moment of profound disconnection and disruption – in mid-winter – my journey will trace a route through places often obscured and forgotten by the growth model consensus. In visiting sites that are, in the weary phrase ‘left-behind’ – I want to ask what models for cultural and community-based resilience remain when the vanguard of late-capitalism has long since disappeared from the horizon.</p>



<p>Focused
on a set of mining communities: the journey will be dark, literally
and figuratively. I want to propose that this ‘darkness,’ as in
much European folklore, is rich with the potential for discovery. 
</p>



<p>The
journey will take in coal communities situated in diverse geographic
and cultural contexts, poised at various different stages of
transition – from pits long-defunct, to those still powering the
factories of Central Europe. Along the way, I will connect with local
activists contending with the pervasive challenges of ecological
destruction and the rise of the far-right. 
</p>



<p>I
will travel with artefacts from the Scottish coalfield, sourced from
the archive, to provoke discussion about communities built around
extractive industries – where ‘de-growth’ of local economies
has long been a lived reality. Older, slower, forms of movement,
fundamental to Scotland’s once vast carbon export industry, play a
role here too. These links demonstrate that commerce and cultural
exchange predate the carbon era, and, even at the height of the coal
industry’s massive export boom, facilitated the emergence of
cultural and social ties. 
</p>



<p>A
key inspiration is Jan Moir and John Berger’s 1975 work of
narrative non-fiction, <em>A
Seventh Man,</em>
which observed the transient life of migrants across Europe —
revealing the notionally marginal figure of the migrant as absolutely
central to modern experience. Similarly, by looking closely at the
lives of several European carbon communities, often located in
geographically peripheral areas, this journey sets out to map a new
geography of power and change. By channelling voices from communities
that have generally been viewed as marginal to life in contemporary
Europe, I will ask what it means to be the last generation of workers
in an industry so central to the continent’s historic dominance.
The journey is premised on the certainty that we can only pursue a
worthwhile low-carbon future, by first exploring the links, cultures
and solidarities forged in the carbon era.</p>



<p>I
also want to consider what a Green New Deal will mean in radically
different contexts across the continent – with an eye on the
origins of the European project in the Coal and Steel Community – a
fundamentally resource based effort, but also a great moral venture. 
</p>



<p>
Where
might a new founding moment be located? Rather than the towering
glass centres of financial and political power, I want to look
underground – in the hills and forests so often dismissed as dirty,
dark and backward – the places where transformations have always
taken place.

<p><strong><em>Roads
to Nowhere: can Scotland Escape the ‘Great Car Economy?’</em></strong><strong><em></em></strong></p>



<p>The use of the term “movement” to describe mass political
organisation has its origins in the mid-19th century. At a time when enormous
industrial growth had created a vogue for speed and motion, the metaphorical
link to transport was clear. Amidst all those new railways, steam packets
ploughing the oceans, and telegraph wires buzzing underneath them — the
association of new politics with the raw energy of industry and progress, that
transformed everything it touched beyond recognition, was perhaps
inevitable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The age of steam, steel and smoke has gone from Scotland. But
something of the way we might want to be radical retains that idea of
forwardness and motion that the dirty monstrous machines of Victorian
capitalism first inspired. In contrast, techno-optimists and most of the
progressive political establishment now project a clean carbon-free future,
where our bodies will be whisked around as seamlessly as a byte of data along a
fibreoptic cable. But mainstream ideas about how we organise the world are
still grounded in our grimy past far more than many would care to admit. As
expressed in the latest advert for the electric Nissan Leaf, we may wish to
float into the futuristic ether, but the reality of feeding machines — made
more efficiently, in ever greater numbers — is resource depletion. All of this
dynamism (expansion) is fired, one way or another, by the exploitation of cheap
natural inputs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s never easy to look at the things capitalism would prefer
hidden — and many of its key innovations in recent years have been about better
masking and obscuring the inherent waste, exploitation, and spiralling
inequality propagated by ‘wealth creation’ and the mindless pursuit of growth.</p>



<p><strong>Old Futures</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p>With the enormity of our own industrial revolution now largely
part of folk memory, contemporary Scottish capitalism sees itself as the smooth
tram ride that takes you out to Edinburgh Airport, via immaculate financial
services offices and reflecting pools. But an equally accurate image of our
‘dynamic’ Scottish economy today is Linwood — the small Renfrewshire town
forever associated with the much loved, if notoriously temperamental, Hillman
Imp. There’s plenty of movement happening in this small corner of the nation —
flights in and out of Glasgow Airport, the constant hum of the nearby M8. But
all those journeys that began here with steel sourced from Ravenscraig, that
included a notoriously inefficient return trip south of the border, are no
longer possible. The lot of Scotland’s post-industrial towns like Linwood was
not so much to disappear — it was to stop being locations where things started,
to become places that people wanted to avoid, to move around. Trip up in the
mobility game, and you easily find yourself lost.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But let’s not dismiss the democratic dreams captured by Scotland’s
national vehicle – and its central role as heroic failure of the post-war
British car industry. The Imp once represented a bridge to the brightest of
light manufacturing futures for workers weaned in the cradle of Victorian heavy
industry. But for many, the rise of car ownership meant something far more
personal too. The freedom of getaways in a cheap, efficient, vehicle brought
the luxury of movement and travel to the many. Whole cities were reshaped
around this grand vision of a family of four moving at 70 mph of their own
accord. The bright era of social mobility enjoyed by baby boomers was made
tangible by this new literalauto-mobility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You could step back, of course, and cooly critique the chaos and
damage created by this oddly conformist freedom — not least because it was
initially premised on cheap oil secured by the rearguard of empire. But that
doesn’t mean this freedom was any less real to those who experienced it. This
revolutionary extension of mobility opened up the country and the many worlds
within it. Like most revolutions, the death toll was contested (but almost
certainly high) much of the old still lingered on alongside the new, and many
of the impacts are still unravelling. But sometimes you just have to move with
the times.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The
Sovereign Driver </strong><strong></strong></p>



<p>As <a href="#https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VTFFDwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=David+Edgerton&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s">David Edgerton</a> has
demonstrated, the Fordist model of ‘welfare capitalism’ — with its core
commitment to affording workers a wage high enough to buy their own product — developed
in the UK in explicitly nationalist terms. As a result, the ability to make and
export cars has long been a symbol of national self-sufficiency, virility even.
Behind coverage of this ever-more precarious sector, with Brexit looming over
what remains of the British car industry, a distinctly <em>national</em> anxiety
is still present. &nbsp;Cross-border supply
chains may guarantee that each vehicle that rolls off an assembly line in
Britain is a thoroughly cosmopolitan machine, but the possibility of car
factory closures still seems to ask a bigger question.<br>
<br>
</p>



<p>Namely, is a nation-state without the ability to make its own cars
really worthy of the title? As <a href="#https://www.lrb.co.uk/login?href=/v31/n11/andrew-ohagan/a-car-of-ones-own">Andrew O’Hagan noted</a> in response
to Labour’s 2009 attempt to boost national car production with a scrappage
scheme, “The downturn in the industry chills us, but mainly because – and we
don’t feel this way about pharmaceuticals or petrochemicals – it makes us
imagine we might have to stop being who we are.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>This deep identification, he argues, is partly due to an imaginative
relationship that casts drivers as “sovereign in their cars.” Perhaps it was a
similar idea of sovereignty that inspired the <em>Gilets Jaunes </em>to adopt a
uniform which identified them explicitly as drivers — as free individuals who feel
the social contract between citizen-driver and state has expired. In Scotland,
the <a href="#https://www.commonspace.scot/articles/14119/learn-gilets-jaunes-stuc-urge-scottish-government-fix-broken-promises-new-green-jobs">STUC has not been coy</a> in implying
that, without establishing a national stake in, and productive base for,
Scotland’s new low-carbon economy, a botched transition could lead to similar
social unrest here.</p>



<p>But support for a sovereign vehicle owner’s democracy, Margaret
Thatcher’s “great car economy,” also means accepting a map of immobility and
social exclusion. This is a key area of policy where Scotland has dutifully
followed in Maggie’s footsteps. Bus services for the poor remain deregulated
and cars rule our roads thanks to lavish state support. Less than a decade ago
we opened the M74 extension (£692m) — a motorway constructed through
communities with some of the lowest levels of car ownership in the UK, in full
knowledge of its negative environmental and social impacts and against the <a href="#https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-13931242">advice of a public
inquiry</a>. </p>



<p>Road building remains a dominant governing priority in Scotland,
with several flagship projects showing the continued popular political
commitment to private cars and their insatiable appetite for greater road
capacity — including the Queensferry Crossing (£1.35bn) and the long-awaited
Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route (£1bn). Current plans also include further
road improvement and building schemes, amounting to roughly £1bn of public
spending across five projects. This can only embed issues around our carbon
heavy transport sector — the dirtiest in the Scottish economy, and one which
saw a<a href="#https://www.theccc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Reducing-emissions-in-Scotland-2018-Progress-Report-to-Parliament.pdf"> notable <em>increase</em>
in emissions over the period 2011-16.</a> </p>



<p><strong>Electric Escapism</strong></p>



<p>Recently, the Scottish Futures Trust has placed fresh emphasis on
electric vehicle charging points — with an eye on the Scottish Government’s
ambitious aim to phase out combustion engines in Scotland by 2032. However,
like most proposals that offer seamless change (the sovereign driver in his
dangerous metal box will remain the key subject of how we organise moving
people around) this policy ignores extensive evidence that electric vehicles
still contribute substantial emissions over the course of their lifecycle,
currently between <a href="#https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/eea-report-confirms-electric-cars">17-30% less than
internal combustion engines.</a></p>



<p>Furthermore, experts have pointed out that air quality issues will
remain, largely due to particles from brake pads and tyres. This is the point
at which the futuristic desire to float into some mystical future begins to
infect policy — the shiny newness of products imbued with ideas of ethereal
cleanliness promising an escape from the present, and by implication from the
finite resources of the planet itself. Yet the reality remains over-tourism
based on luring motorists en-masse to overburdened rural roads, and poorer
communities still disproportionately impacted by bad air quality and road traffic
accidents. </p>



<p>Globally, the inequality embedded by private car use is even
starker. Around 85% of the world’s cars are owned by 15% of the population —
and growing the electric private fleet into the hundreds of millions will be
easily cancelled out by the massive overall rise in vehicles, <a href="#https://theecologist.org/2019/jan/25/electric-cars-wont-stop-rising-oil-demand)">set to double to two
billion by 2035</a>. Technology cannot substitute the enormous political
bravery required to re-balance our priorities away from roads and cars.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Invisible Industry </strong></p>



<p>The assertive language that once mobilised Scottish nationalism
around national industry — that saw post-industrial towns like Linwood seared into the national psyche by the
Proclaimers&#8217; ‘no more’ refrain — has largely disappeared. The sovereign consumer
at the wheel of the family saloon is still with us as a political subject, the
worker who built it is not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As <a href="#https://conter.co.uk/blog/2019/7/26/the-caley-and-scotlands-invisible-workers">Ewan Gibbs argued</a>, the
closure of the Caley rail works in Glasgow provides just one example of how, “Scotland’s existing industrial workers are
rendered historicised and invisible.” Devolution has not inherited this
visceral link between the politics of the nation, and the politics of work and
industry that emerged in the final decades of the last century. This poses
particularly acute challenges for the current transition to a low-carbon
economy, which has seen <a href="#https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-49096996">wind-farm jackets
fabricated in Indonesia</a> and shipped to be deployed in the waters off Scotland —
conspicuously visible from the former industrial heartlands of Fife. &nbsp;</p>



<p>This is just one of the countless local
manifestations of Naomi Klein’s key insight about the climate crisis: ‘we have
not done the things that are necessary to lower emissions because those things
fundamentally conflict with deregulated capitalism.’ The big ideological shift
to neoliberalism in the 1980s has left countries like Scotland shorn of the
industries, skills, public assets and political will required to enact radical
change for the common good. <br>
<br>
</p>



<p>Scotland’s oft-cited (and probably
overstated) antipathy towards the core tenets of Thatcherism and its
successors, does not provide a free pass out of this deeper dilemma, and the
managerialist constraints of devolution seem largely ill-equipped to offer a
fresh perspective. Either way, as Christopher Harvie argued in his 2001 polemic
on the dire state of car-centric Scottish transport policy, we have to confront
the reality of Scotland as: ‘a deindustrialised society, no longer capable of
putting together the sort of technology &#8211; a combination of high-tech and
traditional craftsmanship &#8211; which a modern and environmentally-sustainable
country required.’</p>



<p>Despite all that it represented, the
short-lived Scottish car industry is now another dusty artefact in our draughty
national museum of industrial loss. But how might we re-cast a new vision of
pride, ownership and universalism embodied in the freedom of the open road? </p>



<p>We could depart from the clogged
motorways of the central belt and instead look north to Orkney. With a surplus
of community renewable energy, and inadequate grid infrastructure to export it
south, the islands’ electric car pool operates as a grid battery. In this
model, the driver’s traditional ‘sovereign’ isolation is inverted: each journey
becomes viable as part of a shared network, mobility becomes an asset held in
common. </p>



<p><strong>A Different Pace? </strong></p>



<p>In the mid 20th century, in step with a burgeoning car culture, Scotland’s planners were convinced that population density was the mother of all urban ills. They would go on to pursue measures radical enough to destroy whole communities in an effort to disperse populations. From within a system, such ideologically inspired targets lie beyond question. Looked at from without, after the institutional consensus has crumbled: they are often revealed as absurd and arbitrary. <br> <br></p>



<p>Perhaps part of the problem in establishing a coherent and radical
alternative vision is the all-encompassing need for speed itself. In an age
when billions of pounds literally move through markets in nanoseconds (in some
cases causing vast losses that we don’t fully understand) slowness can be, if
not radical, at least advisable. We need long term, low-return investment,
particularly in grid infrastructure and public transport. The big change
represented by a Green New Deal or Just Transition must be rapid in
implementation, but to work, it must accept an economy that can operate at a
different pace.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Time is the sole irreducible unit of value in our lives. Once it
is spent, we cannot get it back. The fight to protect time from the
encroachment of capital is a long one — a slogan within the historic mass
international movement for an eight-hour working day is useful here: “shorten
our hours to prolong our lives”. That workers were previously often expected to
work well over 60 hours in a six-day week, seems barbaric. Yet today, a
Universal Credit claimant is expected to accept a job offer that requires them
to spend no less than <em>three hours a day</em>
travelling to and from work. For many, the need for mobility is a brutal,
soul-sapping, imposition in pursuit of an arbitrary goal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An economy that does not steer itself towards the accumulation of
ever more things, ripped from the earth at any cost, is also one which would
not demand constant movement. It would escape the tyranny of clocked time
(first introduced in the Victorian factory system to quell labour discontent)
and foreground instead the rhythms of other frames for labour long made
invisible by capitalism — care and nurture, the pattern of the seasons and the
diligence of craft. The alternative is still more rapid depletion of our lives
as human beings, and, ultimately, of the entire web of life on this planet
too.&nbsp;</p>
