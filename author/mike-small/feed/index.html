<p><em>This is an outline of how we might situate degrowth in a history of alternative economics and regenerative movements, in the context of brutal new scientific and socio-economic realities.</em> <em>What does &#8216;true prosperity&#8217; look like in times of socio-ecological crisis?</em></p>



<p><strong>&#8220;Degrowth means primarily the abolition of economic growth as a social objective. This implies a new direction for society, one in which societies will use fewer natural resources and will organize and live differently from today. Ecological economists define degrowth as an equitable downscaling of production and consumption that will reduce societies’ throughput of energy and raw materials. However, the shift should not only entail a smaller <a href="http://www.ejolt.org/2012/11/social-metabolism-and-accounting-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social metabolism</a>, but more importantly a society with a metabolism that has a different structure and serves new functions.&#8221;</strong> &#8211; <em>Riccardo Mastini</em></p>



<p>Degrowth has emerged in recent years as a key idea to understand our time. But as the climate crisis accelerates and intensifies it has moved from being a significant idea to being an essential one. The problem for us is, as some have put it, &#8220;the challenges of realising a utopian necessity.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>DEGROWTH AND THE IPCC</strong></p>



<p>Degrowth is emergent as a set of ideas essential to understanding and responding to the climate and wider ecological crisis. In the latest IPCC report degrowth is discussed as an alternative sustainability concept with a specific take on well-being (chapter 1); in<em> Mitigation pathways compatible with long-term goals</em> (chapter 3), it is discussed as a scenario feature for modelling mitigation pathways; <em>as Demand, services and social aspects of mitigation</em>, it is evoked again in the context of prospective scenarios (chapter 5); and <em>as &#8216;Accelerating the transition in the context of sustainable development</em>&#8216; (chapter 17). (1)</p>



<p>We are, again, at a crossroads, but as the latest two IPCC reports confirm, this crossroads is an existential one. </p>



<p>In response, techno-modernists, capitalists and green socialists offer variations of more of the same. These broad three camps offer first: capitalism tempered by extraordinary and outlandish technologies (&#8216;negative emission technologies&#8217;); second, unfettered capitalism and third, productivism and giant-statism which also seem improbable. Versions of ‘Socialist Growth’ and ‘Luxury Communism’ are also part of these last scenarios. All offer variants of &#8216;business as usual&#8217; and all are based on forms of cycles of production and consumption. Production and consumption have resource implications regardless of whether they are state controlled or market led.</p>



<p>Now, science and ecology are converging on some hard truths, that a growth economy is incompatible with human habitation of our world.</p>



<p>In &#8216;Why degrowth is the only responsible way forward&#8217; Joël Foramitti, Marula Tsagkari and Christos Zografos write: <br><br>&#8220;The latest <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IPCC report</a> to limit global warming to 1.5° presents four scenarios. Three of them strongly depend on negative emission technologies, which are highly controversial as they have not been proven to work at the required scale and represent an “<a href="http://smartstones.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Kevin-Anderson-2016.10.13-the-Trouble-with-Negative-Emissions-Science-2016.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unjust and high-stakes gamble</a>”. The IPCC also provides a fourth scenario that does not rely on negative emissions, but which notably requires that “<a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59bc0e610abd04bd1e067ccc/t/5cb6db356e9a7f14e5322a62/1555487546989/Hickel+-+Degrowth%2C+A+Theory+of+Radical+Abundance.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global material production and consumption declines significantly</a>”.</p>



<p>But if degrowth is the key to responding to the climate catastrophe it is much wider and deeper than that. It is not a mechanistic solution to decarbonisation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="567" height="567" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/E8Vra_VXsAIHLzU.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9409" srcset="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/E8Vra_VXsAIHLzU.jpg 567w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/E8Vra_VXsAIHLzU-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/E8Vra_VXsAIHLzU-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/E8Vra_VXsAIHLzU-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 567px) 100vw, 567px" /></figure>



<p>As Mastini points out (2), in Giorgos Kallis’ landmark book&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.agendapub.com/books/32/degrowth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Degrowth</a></em><a href="https://cup.columbia.edu/book/degrowth/9781911116806" target="_blank" rel="noopener">,</a> he makes three key arguments:</p>



<p>First, the&nbsp;global economy should slow down to avert the destruction of Earth’s life support systems, because a higher rate of production and consumption will run parallel to higher rates of damage to the environment.&nbsp;Hence,&nbsp;we should extract, produce and consume&nbsp;<em>less</em>, and we should do it all&nbsp;<em>differently</em>. Since growth-based economies collapse without growth we have to establish a radically different economic system and way of living in order to prosper in the future.</p>



<p>Second, economic growth is no longer desirable. An increasing share of GDP growth is devoted to&nbsp;‘defensive expenditure,’ meaning the costs people face as a result of environmental externalities such as pollution. Hence, growth (at least in rich countries)&nbsp;has become “un-economic:” its benefits no longer exceed its costs.</p>



<p>Third, and this is key, growth is always based on exploitation, because it is driven by investment that, in turn, depends on surplus. If capitalists or governments paid for the real value of work then they would have no surplus and there would be no growth. Hence, growth cannot reduce inequalities; it merely postpones confronting exploitation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The state of late-capitalist society is so dysfunctional that systems are collapsing and turning in on themselves. This is most peoples lived-reality not the subject for environmental academics. Finally the connection between &#8216;growth&#8217; and exploitation and the colonial mindset is clear. Growth is imperial. Climate crisis is manifest destiny. The criticism of &#8216;green austerity&#8217; doesn&#8217;t recognise this reality and fails to comprehend an approach which brings radical abundance. </p>



<p><strong>EXITING THE ECONOMY</strong></p>



<p>If degrowth grew out of the poverty and emptiness of &#8220;sustainable development&#8221; we can see it here as part of a wider movement of alternative economics and regenerative movements that have emerged since the 1970s. This article aims to situate degrowth in those sister movements and argues that degrowth is the emergent set of radical ideas around which the climate movement and the convergence of radical green and progressive forces (the &#8216;movement of movement&#8217;s) should coalesce.</p>



<p>Degrowth emerged in the late 1970s and was first used by André Gorz. In his book Ecology and Freedom, published in 1977. Gorz was influenced by Jean-Paul Sartre and his philosophy is infused by Existentialism throughout his work.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="474" height="836" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/th.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9752" srcset="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/th.jpg 474w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/th-170x300.jpg 170w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/th-100x176.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px" /></figure>



<p>Gorz doesn’t want to just &#8216;save the planet&#8217;, through his ecology, he defends a wider and deeper vision of humanity, freed from capitalism and the industrial (and post-industrial) society. His &#8216;defence of nature&#8217; requires a better understanding of our own lives, of our actions and values the fundamentals of our society. It is closely allied to Herbert Marcuse&#8217;s critique in One Dimensional Man (1964).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="602" height="955" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/18168760611.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9751" srcset="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/18168760611.jpg 602w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/18168760611-189x300.jpg 189w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/18168760611-585x928.jpg 585w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/18168760611-100x159.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></figure>



<p>André Gorz&#8217;s work is also closely allied to the philosophy of Ivan Illich. In fact Gorz published one of Illich&#8217;s speeches in <em>Les Temps Modernes</em> in 1961 and met him in 1971 in <em>Le Nouvel Observateur</em> at the publishing of <em>Deschooling Society</em> (<em>Une Société sans école</em>). </p>



<p>Gorz would later published a summary of Illich&#8217;s <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tools_for_Conviviality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tools for Conviviality</a></em> (1973) under the title <em>Libérer l&#8217;avenir</em> (Free Future). Illich&#8217;s ideas about &#8216;conviviality&#8217; find new expression and new meaning in degrowth strategies. As we write in <a href="https://www.enough.scot/degrowthhandbook/">Degrowth in Scotland</a> (Conviviality and the Commons): &#8220;The practice &#8216;commoning&#8217; can be understood as the lived experience of conviviality: the &#8216;art of &#8216;living together&#8217; (con-vivere). It involves finding those cultural practices &#8211; those that exist in present, those that have always been there (and are now only being rediscovered) and those that are being created now, for the future &#8211; which restore life and community.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="730" height="1024" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/562_Degowth_Course_Booklet_PRINT-1-730x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9766" srcset="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/562_Degowth_Course_Booklet_PRINT-1-730x1024.jpg 730w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/562_Degowth_Course_Booklet_PRINT-1-214x300.jpg 214w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/562_Degowth_Course_Booklet_PRINT-1-768x1077.jpg 768w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/562_Degowth_Course_Booklet_PRINT-1-585x820.jpg 585w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/562_Degowth_Course_Booklet_PRINT-1-100x140.jpg 100w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/562_Degowth_Course_Booklet_PRINT-1.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" /></figure>



<p>The point in emphasising degrowth&#8217;s origin story &#8211; via Gorz and Illich &#8211; is to recognise that it&#8217;s not just about the economy and it&#8217;s not just about climate and carbon. Degrowth pre-dates the climate crisis. Degrowth calls for the reconceptualisation of life. This was true before the climate crisis.</p>



<p>&#8220;‘Degrowth’ (‘décroissance’) has come to signify &#8220;the desired direction of societies that will use fewer natural resources and will organize themselves to live radically differently. ‘Simplicity’, ‘conviviality’, ‘autonomy’, ‘care’, ‘commons’ and ‘dépense’ are some of the words that express what a degrowth society might look like.&#8221; (3)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="670" height="1024" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/78-670x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9753" srcset="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/78-670x1024.jpg 670w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/78-196x300.jpg 196w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/78-768x1174.jpg 768w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/78-1005x1536.jpg 1005w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/78-585x894.jpg 585w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/78-1170x1789.jpg 1170w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/78-100x153.jpg 100w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/78.jpg 1308w" sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" /></figure>



<p><strong>DECOLONISATION AND DEGROWTH</strong></p>



<p>If degrowth means a new way of living it also has profound implications for relations between people in different parts of the world &#8211; the &#8216;developed&#8217; and the &#8216;undeveloped.&#8217;</p>



<p>If it means as Ben See has put it a shift from the “imperial mode of living”: in which &#8220;a minority of rich people undermining the basic conditions of existence for everyone else, starting with the most vulnerable&#8221; &#8211; it also means &#8216;decolonisation&#8217; which is a contemporary not a historic condition. It is not about tokenistic campus or museum changes in representation it is about stopping the endless and brutal colonisation that is a characteristic of capital.</p>



<p>This idea of permanently extracting energy from people and places, plundering communities and regions is an essential part of our growth-thinking, or certainly the thinking imposed on us. But now colonisation is coming home.</p>



<p>The extractivist economy does not just destroy nature and plunder natural resources, this process is part of the imperial mindset. Ecological destruction and colonisation are intertwined, they are inexorably connected.  But now we are playing catch-up with the stories we are told.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.hachette.co.uk/titles/kojo-koram/uncommon-wealth/9781529338652/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Uncommon Wealth, Britain and the Aftermath of Empire</a>&nbsp;by Kojo Koram the author explores the dynamic between the world of former colonies and Britain. He describes a “boomerang effect” by which what Britain did to its colonies, it is now doing to itself.</p>



<p>Reviewing Koram’s book Eric Rauchway writes (‘<a href="https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/butler-to-the-world-oliver-bullough-american-kleptocracy-casey-michel-uncommon-wealth-kojo-koram-book-review-eric-rauchway/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pirates of the Metropolis’</a>): </p>



<p>“In his elegantly constructed book, Koram is principally concerned to establish that economic development does not work as we were promised. It used to be common to claim that, with time, former colonial possessions would follow a path to modernity and move beyond gross inequality, internal strife and burdensome debt to resemble the prosperous and stable societies of their erstwhile imperial masters. Instead, he notes, history has moved in the other direction, with Britain becoming ever more like the nations of the global South. Moreover, this result has come not from incident but from concerted and intentional action; the undermining of sovereignty is not merely something the colonizers have done to the colonized, but rather what great private wealth has done to all nations, working its way from the periphery to the centre. “Innovations that are implemented for capitalist accumulation in the ‘Third World’, don’t tend to stay there”, Koram writes. The empire used to justify itself with the story that it was helping the colonies to become like the metropolis. Instead, Koram observes, the metropolis has become ever more like the colonies.”</p>



<p><strong>BRINGING IT BACK HOME</strong></p>



<p>If the &#8220;imperial mode of living&#8221; is contrasted with the degrowth alternative, empire, conquest and colonisation are replaced with reinhabitation, nurture and place-knowledge.  <br>In this sense <strong>&#8216;</strong>decolonisation&#8217; and &#8216;reinhabitation&#8217; are twins, key elements that combine to reverse hundreds of years of violent misrule.</p>



<p>In a Scottish context these ideas might draw on traditions of &#8216;thrift&#8217; and frugality and from gaelic traditions of <em>Dùthchas</em> &#8211; a notion of a sense of place and belonging &#8211; as well as our (mislaid) history of ideas around regionalism and bioregionalism.   </p>



<p>Learning to &#8216;live in place&#8217; will become a practical necessity as re-localisation and living within the natural carrying capacity of our bioregions becomes normal as climate breakdown intensifies.</p>



<p>The era in which &#8216;climate breakdown&#8217; is something in the future is long past, and now the very social conditions in western societies are in plain and brutal view.</p>



<p>The prefiguration of this process which has culminated in degrowth can be seen with the waves of regenerative movements and the rise of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDtDoiITi0g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;doomer optimism&#8221;</a>, the intertwined movements of: meta-modernism; neo-localism; decentralisation; bioregionalism and cosmo-localism.</p>



<p>If such movements lacked a radical edge and routinely faltered into forms of bourgeois lifestyle-ism they can be seen as useful skills&#8217; workshops, and consciousness-raising.</p>



<p>If degrowth can be seen as the latest in a line of alternative economic ideas, projects and schemes then the constellation of alternative economics that pre-date and surround degrowth can also be seen as part of a wider momentum. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="640" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FI1yj0eXIAshSk9-1024x640.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9750" srcset="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FI1yj0eXIAshSk9-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FI1yj0eXIAshSk9-300x188.jpg 300w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FI1yj0eXIAshSk9-768x480.jpg 768w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FI1yj0eXIAshSk9-585x366.jpg 585w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FI1yj0eXIAshSk9-1170x731.jpg 1170w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FI1yj0eXIAshSk9-100x63.jpg 100w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FI1yj0eXIAshSk9.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>If some of these are books rather than social movements, and many of them have been subject to corporate capture or assimilation, they can still function as precursors to a wider degrowth moment.  Parecon held/holds a useful debate about a transition away from representative democracy. Wellbeing and circular economics are useful details about our necessary direction, even if they are partial and liberal ideas.</p>



<p>Other tools and alternative economic ideals come from outwith Europe:</p>



<p>&#8220;Degrowth alternatives may involve indigenous ways of organising social life and livelihoods according to the good of the community, for example though Buen Vivir (&#8216;the good life&#8217;), a concept emerging from Ecuador, the inclusive community planning toolkit Plan de Vida (Life Plan) of the Columbian Misak people &#8230; it might take the shape of feminist, anti-corporate activism, such as Vandana Shiva&#8217;s farming and seed saving project Navdanya in Uttarakhand, North India.&#8221; (4)</p>



<p>If degrowth builds on the collective wisdom of Social Ecology, Eco Feminism (5) and forty years of cumulative ecological movement-building, all point to the trajectory outlined by Jason Hickel in saying:</p>



<p>&#8220;The &#8220;economy&#8221; is our material relationship with each other and with the rest of the living world. We have to decide whether we want that relationship to be based on extraction and exploitation, or on reciprocity and care.&#8221;</p>

</figure>



<p>Now, as system-failure accelerates and the social economy collapses, degrowth is becoming the emergent principle from which many of these movements and moments can be seen as stepping-stones of understanding. </p>



<p><strong>UNPOPULAR TRUTHS</strong></p>



<p>Some of these ideas and projects have been assimilated and captured, others were too benign for their own good. For example, it is impossible to find someone who is against &#8216;wellbeing&#8217;, and as such it has no political capital.</p>



<p>Degrowth&#8217;s strength lies in it being an extremely unpalatable concept.</p>



<p>The fact that it generates such a visceral reaction is a good sign.</p>



<p>In 2022 the growth economy, and its inevitable consequences are laid waste and exposed. It is not for the degrowth movement to defend.</p>



<p>The onus is on proponents of the growth world we live in to defend it.</p>



<p>This is all very basic, but for those clinging on to the notion of growth as a dispenser of wealth or a system from which all flourish the facts say otherwise: </p>



<p>&#8220;In 2021, the bottom half of the world population owns less than <a href="https://wir2022.wid.world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2%</a> of global wealth. Compare this to the richest decile (around half a billion people) that owns 76%, or even to the top centile (only 51 million people) that claims 36% of all existing wealth. With their crumb of world wealth, the poorest half of humanity causes only <a href="https://wid.world/document/climate-change-the-global-inequality-of-carbon-emissions-1990-2020-world-inequality-lab-working-paper-2021-21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12%</a> of global greenhouse gas emissions while the richest 10% generate almost half of all emissions. Let that sink in: the top 1% richest individuals (16.8% of global emissions) emit more than the 2.5 billion poorest individuals.&#8221; (6)</p>



<p>An obvious criticism is that much of this is contained within the academic, and within the European sphere and is dominated by a discourse of white men. This all true but the point being laboured is that degrowth emanates from a deeper liberatory tap-root from the movements of radical liberation from the 1960s and 70s.</p>



<p><strong>DEGROWTH AS SOLIDARITY</strong></p>



<p>If decolonisation and reinhabitation offer a conceptual alternative to empire and globlisation, they need to be manifest in reality and in lived experience. They need to be present in everyday life and be visible as tangible assets in the coming struggles.</p>



<p>For this to make sense degrowth needs to become a social movement of change not a set of ideas. This will require a political debate with the wider left which still talks of &#8216;green austerity&#8217; but much more importantly it will require a grassroots community-based movement to build networked-communities experiencing radical abundance as an alternative.</p>



<p>Enough! have started this process in collaboration with other tentative forces and networks.<br><br>This is primarily and firstly about networks of social solidarity in a society characterised by toxic views of class and culture and in a rapidly disintegrating economic context and in which populist and far-right wing visions proliferate. Beyond this deformed versions of libertarianism prosper and this is a challenge for truly liberatory political projects.</p>

<p>Degrowth must also &#8216;land&#8217; in a society in which &#8220;Don&#8217;t Look Up&#8221; is a reality, in which people are either too preoccupied by the stresses of daily survival or in which &#8220;reflexive impotence&#8221; or &#8220;mandatory individualism&#8221; are traits and scars of survival.</p>



<p>How is any of this possible?</p>



<p>One answer is that the climate reality is leaking in to everyday life, from resource wars to flash flooding to extreme weather events to the refugee crisis. This reality can&#8217;t be ignored any longer. The second is that we have just lived through a (cliche klaxon &#8216;unprecedented&#8217;) collective experience that we are still unable to process in which the tendrils of state control and &#8216;benevolence&#8217; have been stretched and questioned.</p>



<p>If the pandemic showed the fragility of things it also showed remarkable social resilience and solidarity. Now the war in Ukraine exposes again the ridiculous precariousness of a society based on externalities. Food and energy are outsourced and uncontrolled. We live in a world which is literally out of control and from our (relative) comfortable western lives we have assumed these benefits are safe and secure.</p>



<p>If the failure of the of the British state and the descent of living standards have become acute this is not likely to propel any change on its own.</p>



<p>The challenge for proponents of degrowth is to make manifest &#8216;radical abundance&#8217; in a society experiencing extremes of poverty and deprivation. That is a political and a conceptual challenge, and one that takes place in a putative semi-state, in a landscape dominated by constitutional issues which tend to obscure all others.</p>



<p>Creating degrowth cultures and changing the narrative about how &#8216;wealth&#8217; is created and what a &#8216;true prosperity&#8217; would look like is the challenge ahead. This is a major challenge in a society deep in climate denial and suffering post-covid PTSD. But is it a challenge that comes in the wake of seismic climate failure and the UK emerging as a sort of failed state, a kleptocracy of elite rule. &#8216;True prosperity&#8217; may seem an elusive and difficult aim but in the context of immiseration and climate failure the status quo is indefensible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>In each issue of Less we will be speaking to people organising around principles of Degrowth as we seek out the trace elements of a new economy and a new society. For this issue we spoke to Alon Schwabe &amp; Daniel Fernández Pascual from the Climavore project on Skye, to Chris Hellawell founder of the Edinburgh Tool Library project and Sophie Unwin founder of the Re-Makery.</em></p>



<p><strong>Less spoke first to Alon Schwabe &amp; Daniel Fernández Pascual asking them how the project works and how the original idea for Climavore came about?</strong></p>



<p>CLIMAVORE started as a framework to explore how to eat as humans change climates. In supermarkets of the global North you see how the sense of seasons has vanished, you can find tomatoes, oranges or salmon pretty much all year round. In response to the&nbsp;climate emergency we started to question&nbsp;what are other seasons we could eat according to today? If we are going through human-made periods of drought, desertification, polluted oceans, etc, how would we adapt food production and consumption landscapes accordingly? CLIMAVORE proposes to respond to those conditions and reimagine food landscapes while divesting from polluting farming practices.</p>



<p><strong>Can you tell us about the On Tidal Zones project on Skye?</strong></p>



<p>The project was initiated&nbsp;around an Atlas Arts Commission in 2017, and has evolved into its own entity. It&#8217;s a response to the environmental impact of salmon farms in Scotland. Through a framework thinking about regenerative aquaculture, it started as an underwater oyster table on the intertidal zone that appears and disappears with the tides. At high tide, it is home for oysters, mussels and seaweeds. At low tide, we have been using it as a dining table for humans to discuss alternative aquacultures for the Isle of Skye. For the past years we have been exploring how to divest away from intensive salmon farming and transition into other regenerative approaches instead, focusing on filter feeders, and collaborating with residents, local restaurants and food establishments, as well as through pedagogical activities and CLIMAVORE apprenticeship programmes.</p>



<p><strong>LESS is exploring how we can live well within ecological limits in the different communities in Scotland we inhabit and engaging with practical real-world projects that embody some of the values of degrowth. One of the things that degrowth argues is that we have to break the cycle of endless extraction. The Tidal Zones project seems to embody that. It is restorative rather than extractive. Is that how you see it?</strong></p>



<p>Certainly. Farmed salmon has grown to such a scale that is comparable to battery-chicken farms and cattle feedlots, it&#8217;s just&nbsp;that we don&#8217;t see what&#8217;s happening&nbsp;underwater. The different initiatives, events, and collaborations with local small-scale producers and restaurants are aiming to transition instead to local seaweeds and bivalves, ingredients that regenerate the water by breathing. They have been a key part of the Scottish diet for centuries, but have been slowly disconnected from people&#8217;s cultural imagination in the past decades. They can nonetheless play a key role in living <em>with</em>&nbsp;the coast.</p>



<p><strong>How does this scale up? It may be a paradox but we need to grow some &#8216;sectors&#8217; and values and restorative food practices is one of them.</strong></p>



<p>Do we need to scale up? It&#8217;s really a hard question that we think a lot about. Many of the problems of industrialised food have precisely come because of scaling up in the name of solving the world&#8217;s hunger. We do need to address food sovereignty and security, but perhaps we also need to take a previous step and first rethink food distribution networks, farming inequalities, toxic runoff, intermediaries, speculation, price dumping, etc. In the same way that many people are thinking about degrowth, we may need to critically challenge the idea of scaling up. In general, we believe that first we need to start unlearning many of the paradigms of the past decades that have caused such an environmental crisis. There is a lot of work to be done, and perhaps it´s worth&nbsp;testing cooperative and small-scale models beforehand.</p>



<p><strong>Food cultures are broken by capitalist production. Is this what you are witnessing in Scotland and does it differ from observations in other places?</strong></p>



<p>The way mainstream food supply works today completely relies on intensive production and extractive systems, except for a minority of initiatives that are supporting more regenerative approaches. In that regard, if you look at salmon farming, you can quickly realise that it is a business completely taken over by a few global corporations that replicate their operations in Scotland, Chile, Tasmania, Norway, and so on. The fact that the technology of open-net pens with highly automated feeding systems repeats itself all over the world, also brings a common struggle towards toxic runoff and depletion of wild counterpart species. So the moment we start identifying salmon farming as a global problem, then we will be able to address ecology at a planetary level and rethink food production in different terms.</p>



<p><strong>We spoke next to Chris Hellawell from the Edinburgh Tool Library and asked him about the origins of the project.</strong></p>



<p>The Edinburgh Tool Library works in the same way that a regular library does, but we lend out tools instead of books.&nbsp; We work on the principle that in sharing resources already in our community, we are reducing the need to buy (and therefore manufacture) more things.&nbsp; The result is a reduction in the carbon footprint of our community, the saving of money, and the saving of space.&nbsp; It also means that ETL has built up an inventory of tools that can be used for other projects too.&nbsp; In much the same way that we want to maximise the usefulness of an individual tool by sharing it amongst as many people as possible, we also recognise that we, as an organisation, are a useful tool for our community too.&nbsp; We have two fully kitted out workshops, and in there we teach skills to our membership, but also people receiving support from other charities, to break down barriers to inclusion.&nbsp; We also offer our resources (volunteers, equipment, space) to make things for other groups.&nbsp; We have in the past built outdoor seating for a community garden, made an outdoor classroom and mud kitchen for a primary school, and are currently refurbishing a vandalised pirate ship.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>ETL is based on a very simple idea of access over excess, and is based on the tool library models you can find across North America.&nbsp; We brought it to the UK, after I visited the Toronto Tool Library, and ever since, there has been a wonderful international collaboration between lots of fantastic organizations worldwide.</p>



<p><strong>LESS is exploring how we can live well within ecological limits in the different communities in Scotland we inhabit and engaging with practical real-world projects that embody some of the values of degrowth.One of the things that degrowth argues is that we have to break the cycle of endless consumption and production.The ETL model of sharing seems to mirror this. We don&#8217;t all NEED to own a lawnmower or a drill or a chainsaw that we only use once a year? </strong><strong>So tool-sharing seems to make sense and also build community and knowledge-sharing. Is that how you see it?</strong></p>



<p>Basically, yes!&nbsp; I’ve been reading The Economics of Arrival by Katherine Trebeck and Jeremy Williams, and this is what we are saying &#8211; there needs to be a point where we have what we need and we stop striving for more ‘stuff’, a point where we have arrived at “Enough”.&nbsp; And the tool library demonstrates that at least in terms&nbsp;of tools, the things we need are already in our community, it’s just a case of people getting access to them, of getting them from a dusty shelf into someone’s hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have also demonstrated that many of the skills needed are also prevalent in our community, and ETL gives our volunteers and our wider community an opportunity to use those skills for the good of others.&nbsp; That might be a volunteer showing someone how to use a particular tool to take home and use themselves, or a group of volunteers coming together to build something for a local school.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fundamentally tool libraries are about maximising the potential of a hammer or saw, but they are also about maximising the potential of a community.</p>



<p><strong>How does this scale up? It may be a paradox but we need to grow some &#8216;sectors&#8217; and values and &#8216;sharing&#8217; is one of them. </strong><strong>Do you see it as a franchise so that you have continuity of values and knowledge &#8211; or can anyone / should anyone set up a tool library? </strong><strong>Is the end goal a tool library in every city or every community?</strong></p>



<p>It is already scaling up.&nbsp; We were the first in the UK 5 years ago, but there are now another 25+ in the UK, and we are doing monthly group seminars with groups looking to set up.&nbsp; Since the summer we have spoken to over 15 such projects.&nbsp; What we don;t have is much capacity, and what we need is governmental support to set up a body to support these groups.&nbsp; The economic benefits are huge (we have shared over £1million worth of tools &#8211; 20,000 loans), and there should be tool and/or sharing library in every community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recently I’ve been reminded of ‘the 3 Rs’ of reduce, reuse and recycle.&nbsp; I think, like many, I learned that as a child, and have always subconsciously put them on a par with each other.&nbsp; But of course they’re not.&nbsp; And I find it particularly jarring that environmental policy seems to push recycling over reduction and reuse, when the recycling sector is built upon the need for waste to be created in the first place.&nbsp; This is completely untenable, and the most resource efficient of the Rs is to reduce consumption in the first place.&nbsp; So yes &#8211; I think the sharing sector has huge potential, and is currently under-explored and under-funded.&nbsp; It goes against a capitalist economic model, but so does human existence on this planet.&nbsp; “Anyone who thinks it’s possible to have infinite growth on a finite planet is either a madman or an economist” &#8211; Kenneth Boulding</p>



<p>We don’t want to go down the franchise model, we want to develop a programme of support to communities to do it themselves.&nbsp; We know how to do tool libraries, but nobody knows a place as well as the people that live there, so every library should grow from the community.&nbsp; We just want to share what we have learned, and our mistakes and our triumphs, and work with people to make something that fits them.&nbsp; There are over 300 sharing libraries worldwide, and no two are alike, so there is a model out there that will suit various circumstances.&nbsp; It might be something that resembles a DIY store, or it might be a cupboard in the village shop, but both are equally valid, and incredibly important to those people that are part of it.</p>



<p><strong>Do you see the ETL as challenging the idea of ownership as in Usufruct [ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usufruct" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usufruct</a></strong><strong> ]?</strong></p>



<p>I see it more as challenging the need for ownership in the first place.&nbsp; I think it aligns the move towards long term rental of things like white goods and household appliances.&nbsp; If manufacturers want to still make a profit, they will need to make things that last, and require less repair, but also that are more modular, and upgradeable and repairable.&nbsp; It also fits with the idea of the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Manifesto" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repair manifesto </a>&nbsp;&#8211; that you don’t own something if you can’t repair it yourself.&nbsp; If you need to go into the Apple store to fix your phone, you are still at their mercy, and they still own a part of the phone.&nbsp; Something that is well made and modular should be easy to fix, or to replace the broken module, and so the cost of repair to the manufacturer or the company you are paying your rent to, is lower.&nbsp; The current situation of built in obsolescence and replacing something as soon as any part of it breaks is completely unsustainable.&nbsp; Until manufacturers are responsible for the lifetime footprint of their product, ETL and other organisations like us are necessary to take up their slack.</p>



<p><strong>You&#8217;ve been pivotal in developing social enterprise in Scotland. How can we best steer social enterprise towards environmental justice and viable responses to climate breakdown? How do you see this developing?</strong></p>



<p>It’s stating the obvious, but Covid-19 has given us all a sudden jolt, and that goes across sectors and industries, and affects us all.&nbsp; There is, however, potential for some good to come out of an awful situation.&nbsp; We have all witnessed a variety of responses from businesses to the crisis, some bad, and some good.&nbsp; Some looking to profiteer, and some looking to support their communities.&nbsp; And in this way, I think, whether or not businesses categorise themselves as social enterprises, the average person on the street has seen that businesses can do good.&nbsp; So I think the idea of a socially minded business is one that we have all experienced.&nbsp; I think that could be a huge gambit to social enterprise in general, and I am hopeful that at the very least, the general public will see that the shops and services in their area form part of their social fabric, and equally that these businesses begin to see themselves as part of the community, and start to take steps to support, and preserve and nurture that community.&nbsp; In that process, I am hopeful that these businesses understand the opportunities that arise from supporting their communities and more widely, environmentalism, and that there is a move towards social enterprise amongst existing organisations, not just new start ups.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We spoke next to Sophie Unwin, the founder of the award-winning Remakery project.</p>



<p><strong>Q1: Can you tell us about how the project works and how the original idea came about?</strong></p>



<p>The Remade Network model is about creating community centres and other social enterprises where people can learn how to fix everyday household objects rather than buying new with workshops in furniture repair, textiles mending, and appointments in how to fix your tech. There are various income streams, including selling refurbished computers and furniture – like a kind of alternative department store. The model is different in different places, from Brixton, where I started work, to Edinburgh, where I developed the business from £60 to £240,000 and 80% traded income, and to Glasgow, where we have established a neighbourhood repair service ‘the Repair Stop’ in Govanhill within the Govanhill Baths Community Trust, which offers affordable repairs in electronics, electrical goods and textiles.</p>



<p>The original idea, like all ideas, probably came about through various things, conversations and experiences – I had the chance to live in a small village in Eastern Nepal over 25 years ago. In a year there, living in a household of six, we created less than a dustbin of rubbish. We reused all our containers, refilled our sacks of rice and pulses, bought vegetables unpacked from the local market, and got milk straight from our neighbour’s cow. When anything broke, it was cheaper to fix than buy new. That experience opened my eyes to the reality behind the myths of economic development – I learned more than I could teach, especially given that as a privileged volunteer teacher the syllabus I was using was a legacy of the Raj – having to teach short stories by Tolstoy and Edgar Allen Poe to rural teenagers who needed to learn conversational English to get jobs.</p>



<p>I’ve always been interested in meaningful work, especially seeing my Dad really hating his job as a banker, and sadly, dying young before he had the chance to pursue many of his dreams. Coming back from Nepal to Brixton, which was previously my home, I felt it was more important to question our western model of growth than import it to other countries! And at 2008, at the time of the economic crash, I was part of my local Transition Town group. I was frustrated to see people like my neighbour, an elderly Afrocaribbean immigrant, struggling to make an income doing bike repairs in his garden. The town hall held a launch of the Brixton Pound and at that launch invited people to share their ideas for things that could help the community – I went on stage, unplanned, and said ‘Why don’t we create a centre where our elderly immigrants can teach our unemployed bankers’ – everyone cheered, and I struck up a conversation with a local woman called Hannah Lewis who wanted to create a project based on the local redesign and reuse of products. We joined forces, and the project was born, first in a pop-up space within Brixton market, and then in a permanent space created by redeveloping a block of disused garages.</p>



<p><strong>LESS is exploring how we can live well within ecological limits in the different communities in Scotland we inhabit and engaging with practical real-world projects that embody some of the values of degrowth. One of the things that degrowth argues is that we have to break the cycle of endless consumption and production. The Remakery model of sharing seems to mirror this. We don&#8217;t all NEED to replace things that could fixed Is that how you see it?</strong></p>



<p>Yes absolutely – I think that it’s about seeing the world differently. Moving away from a mindset of constant upgrades to understanding the value of keeping things longer, buying things that last in the first place. None of this is new – especially in rural communities &#8211;&nbsp; but I think there’s a growing awareness that the old practices of mending and making do and the ones that need to come full circle.</p>



<p>This is both a perspective and a values shift and I think it is a part of a shift from an individualist society to one which is about more cooperative structures which value the common good. That’s certainly what I experienced in rural Nepal – a higher quality of life than the London suburbs where I spent my teenage years. Our mindless growth culture is creating some very toxic outcomes and is spiralling out of control. Repair is a way of slowing down, sharing, and bringing people together, revaluing our belongings and understanding how much our everyday objects take care of us, if we take care of them. It’s also something we’re going to need more and more as we face a likely recession – a way of saving money.</p>



<p>There’s a secondary point – which is that many products are designed to break down in the first place so people buy more of them. So for me the campaigning element of these projects goes hand in hand with the practical project – calling for goods to be built to last and supporting the wider Right to Repair movement.</p>



<p>I think that when people understand that growth is a lie, they wake up to endless new possibilities of living in a more self-reliant and authentically connected life.</p>



<p><strong>How do we – or should we “scale this up” (I’m aware I’m regurgitating jargon)? It may be a paradox but we need to grow some &#8216;sectors&#8217; and values and &#8216;remaking&#8217; is one of them. Do you see it as a franchise so that you have continuity of values and knowledge &#8211; or can anyone / should anyone set up a remakery?</strong></p>



<p>I have set up Remade Network as a network to work collaboratively with other community groups.&nbsp; There’s been a lot of learning so far and I hope that as I continue to develop the model others will be able to share their learning too. Also, I see this model being just as important for tackling inequality as tackling climte change. Others may set up franchises but I believe that heavily branded model is in danger of perpetuating the problems of concentrating wealth and I’m doubtful of its impact – essentially being a service that benefits middle-class audience rather than creating a genuinely redistributive model about salvaging and repurposing resources. In Glasgow I’m working very collaboratively with Repair Café Glasgow, Glasgow Tool Library, Govanhill Baths Community Trust and Glasgow City Council. We share the values around social justice as well as environmental change and these collaborations allow further sharing of resources and ideas.</p>



<p><strong>You&#8217;ve been a huge success in developing social enterprise in Scotland. How can we best steer social enterprise towards environmental justice and viable responses to climate breakdown? How do you see this developing?</strong></p>



<p>Thank you! That’s a big question.&nbsp; I think that social enterprise is understood differently by many people. For me the main question is one of impact and change – we need hugely radical change at the moment if we’re to have a hope of navigating the massive political, ecological and social challenges ahead.</p>



<p>For some people social enterprise is a new way of doing business; for others it’s about business that has some social impact. I think we need to think of social enterprise as a change agent, not just a subset of business – in other words led by the values and impact, and making money as a means and not an end. I’m not sure this is answering the question but in Scotland I would love to see people who are the most affected by climate breakdown having greater agency and power in steering some of the decisions in the policy landscape in social enterprise and beyond.</p>

<p>When we launched the Degrowth Commission in Govan almost a year ago we knew we&#8217;d meet some resistance. The idea of &#8220;growth&#8221; is so hard-wired into our brains it&#8217;s seen as an essential good. </p>



<p>Growth is everything. Growth is deeply associated with progress, both social and personal. Growth is assumed to be the thing that shares wealth. Growth is life. </p>



<p>How can growth be bad?<br><br>We said that growing our economy is costing us our future. </p>



<p>We were ridiculed, but mostly ignored.</p>



<p>The  task of dragging the world into the reality that only degrowing our economy was compatible with a viable future seemed a long-term and difficult political and cultural project. Now, overnight, it&#8217;s our collective reality.<br><br>Boeing has <a href="https://www.rawstory.com/2020/04/boeing-is-no-longer-manufacturing-airplanes-after-closing-its-last-factory-until-further-notice-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shut down</a>. Nobody&#8217;s buying anything they don&#8217;t need. The lockdown, which has seen <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/03/todays-coronavirus-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three billion people</a> under some form of restriction, has grounded flights, emptied buses and trains. The streets and shops are empty. </p>



<p>The coronavirus had the impact to temporarily reduce <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-coronavirus-has-temporarily-reduced-chinas-co2-emissions-by-a-quarter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">China’s CO2 emissions by a quarter.</a></p>



<p>The impact is laid out by <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/author/laurimyllyvirta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lauri Myllyvirta</a> an analyst at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://energyandcleanair.org/" target="_blank">Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air</a> covering air quality and energy trends in <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-coronavirus-has-temporarily-reduced-chinas-co2-emissions-by-a-quarter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">China here.</a></p>



<p>Suddenly we&#8217;ve been thrown into the future we imagined was impossible to achieve.</p>



<p>We are so far off the map that political realities are being re-made. Our collective sat-nav has shut down.</p>



<p>Of course, it is horrific and nothing to celebrate, but it is uncovering so much about our society and our economy.</p>



<p>The first uncovering is social, not ecological.</p>



<p>As Rebecca Solnit writes: &#8220;The first lesson a disaster teaches is that everything is connected.&#8221;</p>



<p>The shared experience of a common global phenomenon is creating fear anxiety and panic. But it&#8217;s also manifesting residual and latent forms of mutualism and community, solidarity and collectivism that we thought had been completely extinguished under late capitalism.</p>



<p>While state action and co-ordination is essential, what we are also seeing is a parallel growth of decentralised neighbourhood action. Freedom lists the <a href="https://freedomnews.org.uk/covid-19-uk-mutual-aid-groups-a-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Covid-19 mutual aid groups in the UK here.  </a></p>



<p>Its important to recognise that these ways of operating have their roots in anarchist forms of organisation:</p>



<p><em>&#8220;The mutual-aid tendency in man has so remote an origin, and is so deeply interwoven with all the past evolution of the human race, that it has been maintained by mankind up to the present time, notwithstanding all vicissitudes of history. It was chiefly evolved during periods of peace and prosperity; but when even the greatest calamities befell men &#8212; when whole countries were laid waste by wars, and whole populations were decimated by misery, or groaned under the yoke of tyranny &#8212; the same tendency continued to live in the villages and among the poorer classes in the towns; it still kept them together, and in the long run it reacted even upon those ruling, fighting, and devastating minorities which dismissed it as sentimental nonsense. </em></p>



<p>&#8211; Peter Kropotkin (Mutual Aid, a Factor in Evolution) </p>



<p>While the virus presents opportunity for the most repressive regimes and reactionary tendencies it also presents unique opportunities for reimagining our economy. This isn&#8217;t easy in a world where people were more concerned that Wimbledon was cancelled than COP 26. It&#8217;s also not easy when these restrictions have been imposed rather than created and in a society where every outlet of the media yearns for a &#8216;return to normal&#8217; and the recommencement of moron culture, <a href="https://www.strike.coop/bullshit-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bullshit jobs</a> and dead ideas.</p>



<p><strong>What does the virus reveal?</strong></p>



<p>That GDP as a measurement, and endless consumerism and hyper-capitalism are destroying not just our planet but our experience of life.</p>



<p>The fragility and precarity of the economy we have endured has been laid open to us.</p>



<p>As the economic anthropologist Jason Hickel notes: &#8220;COVID-19 has revealed that key parts of our economies will need to be relocalized as much as possible, and removed from just-in-time corporate supply chains, including essential medical equipment and basic food supplies.&#8221;</p>



<p> &#8220;There is a bitter irony to the fact that we have all been convinced to use the word &#8220;growth&#8221; to describe what is ultimately a process of depletion and breakdown.&#8221;</p>



<p>The extent to which the growth economy has (and must) undermine the basis of our environment through resource exploitation and extractivism was well known. But what was perhaps less understood, generally, was the extent to which the gig economy and the systems of consumption have depleted our whole society.</p>



<p>Suddenly the task seems to be: <strong>Doing Everything that Should have Been Done Anyway.</strong></p>



<p>From creating the re-localised resilient circular economy we only talked about, to ditching the measurements of GDP we only pretended to take seriously, to reclaiming our food system to being fit for purpose, to creating a universal basic income, to re-understanding our transport and travel culture, to understanding how to use the tools of digital technology in our interests, re-imagining what &#8220;productivity&#8221; actually is, and to understand differently our relationship between generations and what education is and what it&#8217;s for.</p>



<p>There are glimpses that some of this might be beginning to happen (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/amsterdam-doughnut-model-mend-post-coronavirus-economy?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;CMP=twt_gu&amp;utm_medium&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1586327019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8216;Amsterdam to embrace &#8216;doughnut&#8217; model to mend post-coronavirus economy&#8217;</a>). </p>



<p>At a deeper level, questioning growth is also a matter of questioning progress, and this may be a more difficult but a more worthwhile learning from the covid crisis.</p>



<p>This is so profound we are only at the cusp of understanding it.  </p>



<p>Of course there are immediate positive outcomes from this shared experience.</p>



<p>In the midst of lockdown, we are learning that profound, positive change is possible. In the midst of domestic isolation we are (re) learning the need for community and collectivism. In the midst of social distancing we are (re) learning the need for sociability and appreciating our need for nature. </p>



<p>But the dangers are obvious too.</p>



<p>As those studying the ecological / economic phenomenon in China have observed: </p>



<p>&#8220;Overall, the figures reinforce my estimate that China’s carbon emissions fell by around 25% over a four-week period, as outlined below, equivalent to around 200m tonnes of CO2 (MtCO2). Demand slowly returned to normal levels over an extended seven-week period, bringing the reduction so far to around 250MtCO2, with emissions some 18% lower than usual levels.&#8221;</p>



<p>The demand to &#8220;return to normal&#8221; and decimate all of the ecological social and cultural gains will be overwhelming.</p>



<p>We will be complicit in this &#8220;return&#8221; unless we can articulate a response. </p>



<p>The dark tragedy is this:</p>



<p>We have been catapulted to the future we demanded and are presented with vast opportunity to create a radically different and ecologically viable economy. But all of the forces in society that benefited from the pre-covid world are working for a fast return to radical unsustainability and uncertainty.</p>



<p>Elite forces want us to return as soon as possible to a world hurtling to climate disaster, extreme inequality and hierarchy, pointless and useless work and endless growth. Capital wants us to return as quick as possible to constant consumption and mindless economic activity. We must resist this will all the force we can manage and with all of the enlightenment we have glimpsed at in our experience of lockdown. </p>



<p>A return to a growth economy and the numbing comforts of hyper-consumerism would be the worst possible outcome. As the author <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/10d8f5e8-74eb-11ea-95fe-fcd274e920ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arundhati Roy </a>writes:</p>



<p>&#8220;Our minds are still racing back and forth, longing for a return to “normality”, trying to stitch our future to our past and refusing to acknowledge the rupture. But the rupture exists. And in the midst of this terrible despair, it offers us a chance to rethink the doomsday machine we have built for ourselves. Nothing could be worse than a return to normality. Historically, pandemics have forced humans to break with the past and imagine their world anew. This one is no different. It is a portal, a gateway between one world and the next. We can choose to walk through it, dragging the carcasses of our prejudice and hatred, our avarice, our data banks and dead ideas, our dead rivers and smoky skies behind us. Or we can walk through lightly, with little luggage, ready to imagine another world. And ready to fight for it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Roy is right to see the pandemic as a &#8220;portal&#8221;, but if we aren&#8217;t careful, the portal will close as we stare blinking at the opportunities it presents us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Netflix craze of the year is the comforting appearance of <a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80209379" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marie Kondo </a>bringing her domestic Zen presence to Western homes.  De-cluttering as crisis-management, a sort of pious lifestyle comfort-viewing for the existentially distressed.  </p>



<p>It’s the world being sorted by folding towels properly.</p>



<p>But there’s a deeper current at play, and that’s the crisis
of accumulation. Even Marx knew this: “Accumulate, accumulate! That is Moses and the prophets!
…Accumulation for accumulation’s sake, production for production’s sake”. <a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>
This is the essence of capital.</p>



<p>Of course you can’t “de-clutter” a system that is based
entirely on persuading you to buy things you don’t need, just as a beach clean-up&nbsp; from an economy spewing out single-use
products is doomed to only the most self-denying branches of cheery lifestyle
media.</p>



<p>We live in a world balanced by two contradictory
imperatives: to constantly throw away and discard, and simultaneously to
relentlessly accumulate and hoard possessions. </p>



<p>We are taught these behaviours and have to navigate through
a world of semiotics and a bombardment of advertising</p>



<p><strong>Kondo</strong></p>



<p>Kondo’s craze is like the reality of western life spilling
out of the garage, seeping out of the hoarder’s dysfunctional bedroom and
crashing through the kitchen door. As a metaphor for the recent IPCC report it
hits the mark.</p>



<p>Cycles of endless production and endless consumption are the be-all-and-end-all of the capitalist economy. Last year brought the revelation to the mainstream mind that this is entirely un-survivable, that free-market economics are a threat to life on Earth.</p>



<p>In the face of a crisis like climate change,
which clearly demands collective action and strong regulation, our ecology has
come into direct conflict with our assumed wisdom about the world.&nbsp;We need
to cut our emissions so deeply that it threatens the whole growth model of
free-market capitalism.</p>



<p><strong>Less</strong></p>



<p>Economists – not just ecologists &#8211;&nbsp; are now talking about moving beyond the idea of growth.</p>



<p>We know chasing endless growth doesn’t
deliver well-being or economic stability and is leading to widening and
disfiguring inequality. </p>



<p>We know that endless growth is causing such
resource-depletion and biodiversity loss as to cause an imminent threat to our
ecosystems.</p>



<p>The threats and warnings are everywhere and
have been for decades, hidden from view by: our lack of immediate exposure; our
inability to process or conceive of such things; our complicity in the system
and benefits of such economics; and by vested interests pumping propaganda into
our world.</p>



<p>But now it’s getting hotter and the
relentless build-up of evidence is overwhelming.</p>



<p>“Researchers
at MIT warn that if climate change remains unchecked, over half a billion
people will, from 2070 onwards, experience humid heat waves that will kill even
healthy people in the shade within 6 hours.” <a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a></p>



<p>It’s clear we need to have a strategic
economy, focusing on parts we want to expand or extract. But this is impossible
if we don’t own or control our own resources.</p>



<p>And this is difficult for many for us as a
society who are psychologically immersed in and wedded to the idea of growth
and accumulation.</p>



<p>Our children grow, plants grow, to get more
is good, to get more and more is better, without end.</p>



<p>But children stop growing and plants grow and
die in a cycle of life.</p>



<p><strong>Insubordination</strong></p>



<p>Our fetishisation of growth has to stop.</p>



<p>Some excellent words from the catchily titled:  <em>I<a href="https://www.ipbes.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ntergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services.</a></em><a href="https://www.ipbes.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> </a>Their report on how to reverse biodiversity collapse states simply: </p>



<p>&#8220;A
key constituent of sustainable pathways is steering away from the current
limited paradigm of economic growth&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;That implies incorporating the
reduction of inequalities into development pathways, reducing overconsumption
and waste and addressing environmental impacts such as externalities of
economic activities, from the local to the global scales&#8230;&#8221; </p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Such an
evolution would also entail a shift beyond standard economic indicators such as
gross domestic product to include those able to capture more holistic,
long-term views of economics and quality of life.&#8221; </p>



<p>Of course such a challenge seems impossible and the idea that we should do less, produce less, consume less and avert our eyes from the relentless task of consumption is so alien to what we have been groomed to understand. <br><br>But it is not impossible.</p>



<p>But to succeed we
must move beyond not just lifestyle-environmentalism but the silos of social
movements. To succeed we must not just embrace degrowth but we must find the
revolutionary politics which “sparks joy”.</p>



<p>Degrowth is
refusing to be subordinated.</p>



<p>Refusing to engage
in consumerism is an act of insubordination.</p>



<p>As John Holloway
said in a recent talk in Edinburgh:&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>“The failure of capitalism is likely to become more and more evident. It will be crucial to show that this is not a failure of the capitalists to manage the economy, but the failure of capital to subordinate us adequately to ensure its own reproduction, that <em>we</em> are the crisis of capital. Our lack of subordination not only secures a multiplicity of small successes, but shakes the system and pushes beyond it.”<br></p>

			<p>So suggests a new report commissioned by a group of scientists appointed by the UN Secretary-General. The main reason?:</p>
<p>“We’re transitioning rapidly to a radically different global economy, due to our increasingly unsustainable exploitation of the planet’s environmental resources.</p>
<p>Climate change and species extinctions are accelerating even as societies are experiencing rising inequality, unemployment, slow economic growth, rising debt levels, and impotent governments. Contrary to the way policymakers usually think about these problems, the new report says that these are not really separate crises at all.</p>
<p>Rather, these crises are part of the same fundamental transition to a new era characterized by inefficient fossil fuel production and the escalating costs of climate change. Conventional capitalist economic thinking can no longer explain, predict, or solve the workings of the global economy in this new age, the paper says.”</p>
<p>It may be mundane but the reality is that Energy Return on Investment (EROI) – a simple ratio that measures how much energy we use to extract more energy – may be presenting the endgame for the fossil fuel economy that lies beneath western economics.</p>
<p>The timeline between our diminishing finite fuel resources, and our inability to transition to a low-carbon economy has been a dance between political intransigence, consumer duplicity and corporate greenwashing.</p>
<p>In a new book published by Pluto this month Simon Pirani explains the contradictions and roots of the crisis in <a title="" href="https://www.plutobooks.com/blog/truth-fight-against-fossil-fuels/?preview=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.plutobooks.com/blog/truth-fight-against-fossil-fuels/?preview%3Dtrue&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1536684762631000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGiTcrdYpRa3_MvX4_V7Sh33dC6ow">“The Truth about the Fight Against Fossil Fuels”:</a></p>
<p>“When politicians and diplomats meet in Katowice, Poland, in December for the 2018 round of international climate negotiations, they will not even pretend to aim at cutting greenhouse gas emissions – mostly from burning fossil fuels – far enough to prevent dangerous climate change.<br />
The negotiators’ modest aim is to leave Katowice with an agreed procedure for monitoring implementation of promises that countries made to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions at the Paris climate conference in 2015.</p>
<p>Even if all the governments involved keep all their promises (like that has ever happened!), we are heading by 2100 for global average temperatures 2.6 degrees above the pre-industrial level. The Paris agreement itself said that margin should be ‘well below’ 2 degrees, and that countries would ‘endeavour’ to keep it to 1.5 degrees.”</p>

			<p>As Pirani explains:</p>
<p>“The failure in Paris to make the climate arithmetic add up was the culmination of decades of failure by the world’s leading states to slow down, let alone reverse, consumption growth of fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) – which is the source of about three quarters of all human-made greenhouse gases.</p>
<p>Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels in 2017 were 56% higher than they were in 1992, a quarter century earlier, when the first international agreement to tackle climate change was made at the Rio summit.”</p>
<p>That’s an incredible fact which speaks to a global failure.</p>

			<p>Now, for the first time experts have calculated the precise figure of carbon Scotland can (and cannot) produce to keep in accord with the Paris agreement <a href="http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/16599722.experts-call-for-north-sea-oil-closure-to-cut-climate-pollution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/16599722.experts-call-for-north-sea-oil-closure-to-cut-climate-pollution/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1536684762631000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEPsDBUEh84yM22O-mFg1ZwbzIxfw">“Experts call for North Sea oil closure to cut climate pollution”.</a></p>

<p><strong>On Leadership and Change</strong></p>
<div id="m_-8272684001777254592m_-4504758609523762666subscription-content">
<p>The Herald reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>
“For the first time the scientists worked out Scotland’s carbon budget under the international climate agreement made in Paris in 2015. They conclude that for Scotland to meet its global responsibilities it can only emit a total of 300 million tonnes more carbon dioxide – meaning it has to cut emissions by at least ten per cent every year starting now.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>The report points out that if the world is to meet international climate targets 70-80 per cent of known fossil fuel reserves must stay in the ground. “Scotland needs to begin an urgent and phased closure of its oil and gas sector,” it says.</p>
<p>Now this is going to cause some problems.</p>
<p>No-one really wants to do anything, even though the overwhelming evidence is that the world is teetering on the brink of catastrophic change.</p>
<p>Real courageous leadership is conspicuous by its absence.</p>
<p>No-one wants to give up the lifestyle they’ve assumed is their right.</p>
<p>At either end of income scale in developed countries there’s little appetite for change.</p>
<p>Many of the wealthiest people have made their money from resource exploitation and can’t see beyond it.</p>
<p>Many people suffering in poverty don’t see how this ‘crisis’ is to do with them or how they might have agency to change such a reality.</p>
<p>Many people who want to see an independent Scotland are still obsessed by the “It’s Scotland’s Oil” trope of the 1970s. Many will no doubt claim that “it will make no difference” and we should use every last drop.</p>
<p>I fully expect this column to be flooded by such comments afterwards.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not Scotland’s oil, its Shell’s Exxon’s and BP’s. And yes we could tax them and yes we could create an Oil Fund – but we would be doing so at least thirty years too late. Other emerging industries, and non-industries have far more potential and far less destructive impact.</p>
<p>We need to stop being obsessed with oil.</p>
<p>We need to abandon fossil fuels.</p>
<p>We have most of the technology in place and we are remarkably blessed with tidal, wave, wind and hydro capacity.</p>
<p>It’s a weird space to be in where the climate deniers are us, even in the face of overwhelming crisis, changing weather patterns and extinctions.</p>
<p>The report is scarily precise, naming companies and attributing specific emissions to each of them. We can close them down, we can find alternative employment, but we won’t, not just out of the exertion of corporate power, but out of our own complicity, cowardice and inertia.</p>
<p>That’s how this ends, by us doing nothing at all.</p>
