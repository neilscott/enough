<p><em>This is a response to the findings from a trio of new ‘</em><a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-whole-energy-system-scenarios-context-document/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>energy scenarios</em></a><em>’ commissioned by the Scottish Government which show possible pathways for the energy system to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2045. The scenarios will inform the government’s upcoming energy strategy which will outline the future of the sector in Scotland.&nbsp;</em>By Bronagh Gallagher and Mike Small.</p>



<p>To understand which energy scenario will best help Scotland achieve net zero by 2045, we need to be really clear about what question we are trying to answer. As the events in Pakistan and the current cost-of-living crisis in the UK most vividly demonstrate, how we understand what is driving the climate crisis and, therefore, how we best respond is a matter of life and death.</p>



<p>On the surface, the scenarios offer lots of potential and good ideas to work with. However, they also create the impression that what is driving excess emissions is simply that we are producing more carbon than the atmosphere can handle, so let’s just get rid of it. Or, alternatively, it is us, as individuals, through our lifestyles who are generating too much carbon and so let’s change what we eat. And while there is a partial truth in both of these responses, they are overwhelmingly incomplete. Limited by a narrow socio- technical framing and a lack of deeper analysis all of the options outlined fundamentally fail to engage with the depth of change truly needed to achieve net zero by 2045.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>The technological option relies on the same logic which has brought us to this point &#8211; that we can keep producing and consuming at an increasing rate as long as we capture the emissions generated. Framed purely as an issue of excess Co2, this removes from view other essential considerations, such as the devastation to ecosystems that accompanies increasing resource use and the unequal relations of production and consumption between north and south which are fundamental to global inequality.</p></blockquote>



<p>The lifestyle change option directs attention away from the real problem which is not that we eat too much meat or drive too much, but that our society and economy are structured in such a way that these are the options that are most easily convenient for us. And, to be clear, this is a direct result of political and economic decisions made by politicians, often influenced by the needs of large corporations.</p>



<p>These are inadequate solutions to the wrong question.</p>



<p>&nbsp;If we widen the angle and broaden the question to instead ask: why we are producing too much carbon and why are the things we produce and consume leading to such high emissions, then we get a very different answer to which scenario is best.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, what is really driving the climate crisis? To put it simply, our economy. We live in an economic system which prioritises profit above all else, and how this economic system generates ever more profit is through increased production and consumption which means more digging, more mining, more burning and more drilling &#8211; that is more and more emissions in parallel with the increasing loss of natural sinks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If we instead asked the question &#8211; how could we organise our society and economy so we all live well within planetary limits &#8211; we get a very different energy scenario.</p>



<p>Fortunately, this very question was asked and answered by the <a href="https://lili.leeds.ac.uk/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://lili.leeds.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Living Well Within Limits project</a> at Leeds University. The research successfully modelled that it was possible for all people, globally, to live good lives not through behaviour changes or techno-fixes but by fundamentally changing how we organise our society and economy so that we can meet people&#8217;s material needs &#8211; for food, for housing, for healthcare for transport &#8211; not through private markets oriented towards profit but through the public and free provision of these public and social goods. This expansion of public goods is then accompanied by downscaling of the amount of unnecessary and luxury consumption there is &#8211; think SUV’s, not food and wifi.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s worth drawing out here, it&#8217;s not that changes don’t need to be made to how we do things and how we live our lives, it’s more that responding to climate breakdown doesn’t need to be hardship and lack. Responding to the push for net zero by 2045 could be the catalyst we need so that each of us can live more meaningful and less stressful lives. We can do so much better for everyone than we are living through now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How would this scenario result in Scotland achieving net zero by 2045? At its most basic this helps us reduce the amount of energy we need and, therefore, carbon we produce because we are focusing our energy needs on ensuring that everyone can live a good life through public goods &amp; services and not through our ability to buy things to meet needs.</p>



<p><strong>What does this say for a degrowth energy scenario?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Let’s be clear, a degrowth energy scenario is not recession and it is not austerity. It would be downscaling our energy needs in a way that is modelled by LiLi. &nbsp;A degrowth approach to energy would focus on the need for an energy descent plan, ensuring everyone&#8217;s essential needs are met as a foundation, and not just an assumption of endless energy output increases. This would stem not from individual domestic actions but from wholesale structural changes that would benefit all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Specifically, as degrowth advocates &#8211; and people who want everyone in this country and elsewhere to have what they need to survive and thrive &#8211; we would call for:<br><br>&#8211; initial public ownership of energy companies with a rapid transition to 100% renewables&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8211; degrow output and shift to new metrics for measuring &#8216;economic success’</p>



<p>&#8211; Guarantee Green jobs programme&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8211; high investment levels in health, education, housing and community services</p>



<p>&#8211; investment in local food strategies</p>



<p>&#8211; Democratising land ownership in Scotland&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8211; Free and extensive public transport networks</p>



<p>&#8211; ‘predistribution ‘ &#8211; preventing widespread levels of inequality rather than ‘correcting’ it after it has become endemic</p>



<p>&#8211; a massive commitment to ‘Insulate Scotland’</p>



<p>None of the proposals from the Climate X Change project will allow us to reach Net Zero by 2045 on their own. These approaches &#8211; micro-actions or a commitment to the ‘magical thinking’ of techno-fixes are proven failures that have brought us to our present crisis. Behaviour changes are a red herring deployed to make us feel like we, as individuals, are the real problem and can individually provide a real solution. As we experience the intensification of economic, climate and political crises our responses need to be of a higher order, bolder, and deeper actions that accelerate the just transition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An Energy Strategy that truly matched the severity of the crises and delivered net zero by 2045 would also be an economic strategy and a social strategy. It would go far beyond socio-technological shifts to catalyse the transformation of our socio-economic systems. This might seem too big, too unrealistic (and outwith the bounds of an energy scenario) but it is the only choice we have if we truly respond to the times we are in, in a way that is just, fair and ecologically balanced.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>LESS is a journal of degrowth, radical sufficiency and decolonisation in Scotland.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>LESS questions and challenges dominant narratives about what economic progress means in Scotland, and sketches out alternative visions. The focus is on collective and democratic solutions to sustaining livelihoods that meet people’s needs while rising to the threats of climate change, ecocide and mass extinction, inequality, racism and the far right, and the interconnected oppressive and extractivist logic that feeds all of these.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For our second issue we invite a combination of commentary relating to degrowth, opinion pieces, poetry and art work, as well as stories about practical action. Contributions are invited from people with lived knowledge in these areas, researchers, poets, creative writers and artists.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Meeting our needs in a place we call home&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The second issue of LESS will be looking at degrowth in the context of Brexit and the pandemic. We invite contributions around themes such as</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>co-creating welcoming communities in Scotland within ecological limits</li><li>strengthening and restoring alternative economies in Scotland and connections with European grassroots networks&nbsp;</li><li>post-pandemic recovery compatible with degrowth principles </li><li>resisting climate breakdown and the unraveling of our fragile ecosystems</li></ul>



<p></p>



<p><strong>To respond to the Open Call,</strong> please email your proposal of no more than half a page + a short bio or link to your work by Sunday, the 14th of February to info@enough.scot with &#8220;LESS2 proposal&#8221; in the subject line. We aim to get back to you within a few days to let you know if your piece has been accepted. </p>



<p>Upon receiving confirmation that your piece has been accepted, it should be submitted within a couple of weeks, and should be approximately 2000 &#8211; 3000 words in length for articles (although other formats are accepted). We pay a fee of £240 for each published piece.</p>

<p><strong>Enough!</strong> is one of many groups and projects featured on a new website that launches this week: <a href="http://www.necessity.info" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.necessity.info</a> </p>



<p><strong><a href="http://necessity.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NECESSITY</a></strong> is a <strong>living archive</strong> rooted in social and environmental justice. The site aims to share <strong>stories, learning and research</strong> from across the UK. It supports communities to strengthen and adapt to ongoing economic and climate challenges. It also offers <strong>funding</strong> to increase the capacity of people, projects and networks within the UK. </p>



<p><strong><a href="http://necessity.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NECESSITY</a></strong> is a <strong>development platform, </strong>and as such it continually changes as it gathers new information, investigates pressing emerging issues and fosters collaboration. It aims to contribute to a world that imagines living without profit as its bottom line and growth, extraction and consumption as its drivers; facing up to the deep contradictions within our lives and current systems; sharing potential ways of creating change.</p>



<p><strong><a href="http://necessity.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NECESSITY</a></strong> is a <strong>site for experiments</strong>, encouraging honesty about failure as much as success. It is a place through which individuals and communities that experience exclusion can share their voices, experiences and wisdom. It seeks to give shape to a bias to the margins and the deep belief that market-driven economies are failing the planet and people. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>The new site is launching with the following <strong>three core features:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong><a href="https://necessity.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Living Archive</a></strong> &#8211; Information of over <strong>60 projects/networks </strong>working in social and environmental justice.</li></ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong><a href="https://necessity.info/resource-library" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resource Library</a> </strong>&#8211; helpful videos, reports and links to share and develop learning and capacity.</li></ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong><a href="https://necessity.info/funding-and-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Funding and Research </a></strong>&#8211; Throughout each year, <strong>Necessity</strong> will offer various <strong>funding</strong> opportunities in alignment with its core themes. This will not only help support the capacity development of people, projects and networks across the UK, but also create a continual stream of ideas, provocations and learning for everyone who visits the site. </li></ul>

<p><strong>NECESSITY</strong> is supporting people and projects engaging across its core themes:<br><br><strong>FOOD SYSTEMS AND STRUCTURES </strong>– initiatives ranging from community food growing to land justice questions.</p>



<p><strong>DECOLONISATION AND POST-GROWTH ECONOMIES  </strong>– disrupting the foundations and  understandings of the current economic systems, whilst seeking to initiate discussions and examples of life beyond growth driven systems.</p>



<p><strong>DOMESTIC RESILIENCE AND CREATIVE COMMUNITIES </strong>– identifying the links between households, lifestyles, violation and empowerment,  power-dynamics and flourishing neighbourhoods.</p>



<p><strong>RADICAL RECONCILIATION </strong> – exploring the inter-relational dynamics between people and planet. Opening space to consider the ‘big questions’ of life and meaning.</p>



<p><strong>ENVIRONMENTAL AND HUMAN RIGHTS  </strong>– seeking to ‘stand in the gap’ with those most marginalised through the current economic and environmental inequalities.</p>

<p><strong>What did lockdown reveal about ourselves, our communities, our society, our government? From across Scotland, we want to gather some of the #learningfromlockdown.</strong></p>



<p>We want to hear your thoughts; good, bad, indifferent. Personal reflections or political rants. What have we learnt about <em>what really matters</em>? And as the return to ‘normal’ ramps up &#8211; what about &#8216;normal&#8217; might we not want back? What must we remember?</p>



<p>In some ways, the lockdown has been an unprecedented collective experience. In other ways lockdown has been far from a shared experience — revealing shameful inequalities around health. Where these have been hard lessons — what must not be forgotten? By who?</p>



<p>What has the pandemic uncovered, for us, about our economic system and the other structures that we depend upon to support us during hard times? We have seen inspirational responses from community and mutual aid groups across the country. What has this experience taught us that needs to be captured and shared?</p>



<p>We plan to gather together responses to record this moment. If there are lessons to be learned, we want to share them so that they can shape the conversations going forward. Conversations about the kind of recovery that will deliver more equality or stave off future crises in Scotland. How we collectively rebuild our lives, our economy and our society, in a world radically altered by the pandemic.</p>



<p>We want to be creative in how we share back responses publicly. This might be through our website, via large-scale projections or in local window displays. When we share we’ll use your words but nothing else — this is about sharing the learning, rather than who learnt it.</p>



<p><strong>Share yours by using the hashtag #learningfromlockdown (hashtag which community you’re tweeting from) or share your thoughts on Enough&#8217;s #learningfromlockdown <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/scotlandlearningfromlockdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/scotlandlearningfromlockdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><a href="https://bit.ly/39GIgTU" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a>Facebook group.</a> </strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-button"><a class="wp-block-button__link" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/learningfromlockdownscotland" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook Group</a></div>



<p>This is an experimental process for us.  If you have ideas as to how this might be useful to your community &#8211; we’d love to hear from you. We’re also aware that it’s overly reliant on digital access. We are exploring how to take this offline — using postcards or chalk art. If you have other suggestions, let us know. If you are a community organisation and you want to use this idea or hashtag in your own community &#8211; please go ahead!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A Call from Scotland to Embrace Degrowth Thinking on </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GlobalDegrowthDay?src=hashtag_click" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>#GlobalDegrowthDay</strong></a><strong> </strong><br>Saturday 6th June, 2020</h3>



<p><strong><em>As long as our economy is dependent on growth, any ‘economic recovery’ from the coronavirus will be a disaster. Instead, Scotland needs a planned, sustainable, and equitable downscaling and a fundamental reorganising of the economy.</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>Today, on #GlobalDegrowthDay, we lay out some principles of degrowth for those not familiar with the idea and ask: What would the economy of a degrowth Scotland look like?</em></strong></p>



<p>The Scottish Government’s ‘<a href="https://www.sustainablegrowthcommission.scot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sustainable Growth Commission</a>’ calls for an “inter-generational economic renaissance”, but starts from the impossible premise that economic growth can be made sustainable. As we think about how to repair and reconstruct our economy following Covid-19, Enough’s <strong>Degrowth Commission</strong> is calling on the Scottish Government, civil society and communities to embrace ideas of degrowth.</p>



<p>Put simply, degrowth is “<a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/degrowth-new-roots-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a planned yet adaptive, sustainable, and equitable downscaling of the economy, leading to a future where we can live better with less</a>.” Degrowth does not mean ‘shrinking’ all areas of human life or of the economy. It allows for the creation of <em>more of what we need</em>, and <em>less</em> useless material goods and toil.</p>



<p>There is a growing movement for degrowth economics worldwide. A <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/degrowth-new-roots-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent letter</a> from the <a href="https://www.degrowth.info/en/open-letter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Degrowth Network</a>, published in the UK by <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/degrowth-new-roots-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Democracy</a>, has pointed out that the crisis triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic has exposed weaknesses of growth-driven capitalist economies. Crippled healthcare systems, austerity, climate change, poverty and hunger and biodiversity loss cause millions of deaths every year. The letter states:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“For decades, the dominant strategies against these ills were to leave economic distribution largely to market forces and to lessen ecological degradation through decoupling and green growth. This has not worked. We now have an opportunity to build on the experiences of the Corona crisis: from new forms of cooperation and solidarity that are flourishing, to the widespread appreciation of basic societal services like health and care work, food provisioning and waste removal. The pandemic has also led to government actions unprecedented in modern peacetime, demonstrating what is possible when there is a will to act: the unquestioned reshuffling of budgets, mobilization and redistribution of money, rapid expansion of social security systems and housing for the homeless.”</p><cite>Degrowth New Roots Collective</cite></blockquote>



<p></p>



<p>This letter has been published in 18 languages and <a href="https://www.degrowth.info/en/our-projects/open-letter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed</a> by more than 1,100 experts and over 70 organisations from more than 60 countries.</p>



<p><strong>The experience of Covid-19 has taught us something we already knew, now made explicit: a different kind of world is not just possible; it is a crucial and urgent necessity. </strong></p>



<p>We cannot return to our toxic past and “business as usual”. The old growth economy, based on hyper-consumerism, was one marked by gross inequality, catastrophic carbon emissions and a globalism that was committing us to omnicide. Any return to “normal” will not just be socially disastrous, it will ensure that our current trajectory for climate catastrophe is ensured. The endless cycle of production and consumption must cease.</p>



<p>As this oft-quoted passage by <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/10d8f5e8-74eb-11ea-95fe-fcd274e920ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arundhati Roy</a> reflects:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Nothing could be worse than a return to normality. Historically, pandemics have forced humans to break with the past and imagine their world anew. This one is no different. It is a portal, a gateway between one world and the next. We can choose to walk through it, dragging the carcasses of our prejudice and hatred, our avarice, our data banks and dead ideas, our dead rivers and smoky skies behind us. Or we can walk through lightly, with little luggage, ready to imagine another world. And ready to fight for it.”</p><cite><br><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/10d8f5e8-74eb-11ea-95fe-fcd274e920ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arundhati Roy</a></cite></blockquote>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5 Principles for Degrowth Recovery</strong></h4>



<p>Enough! today shares the <strong>5 international principles</strong> for a just recovery of our economy and the basis of creating a just society. To develop new roots for an economy that works for all, we need to:</p>



<p>1) <strong>Put life at the center of our economic systems. </strong>Instead of economic growth and wasteful production, we must put life and wellbeing at the center of our efforts. While some sectors of the economy, like fossil fuel production, military and advertising, have to be phased out as fast as possible, we need to foster others, like healthcare, education, renewable energy and ecological agriculture.</p>



<p>2) <strong>Radically reevaluate how much and what work is necessary for a good life for all. </strong>We need to put more emphasis on<a href="https://globalwomenstrike.net/open-letter-to-governments-a-care-income-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> care work</a> and adequately value the professions that have proven essential during the crisis. Workers from destructive industries need access to training for new types of work that is regenerative and cleaner, ensuring a just transition. Overall, we have to reduce working time and introduce schemes for work-sharing.</p>



<p>3) <strong>Organize society around the provision of essential goods and services. </strong>While we need to reduce wasteful consumption and travel, basic human needs, such as the right to food, housing and education have to be secured for everyone through universal basic services or universal basic income schemes. Further, a minimum and maximum income have to be democratically defined and introduced.</p>



<p>4) <strong>Democratize society. </strong>This means enabling all people to participate in the decisions that affect their lives. In particular, it means more participation for marginalized groups of society as well as including<a href="https://www.degrowth.info/en/2020/04/feminist-degrowth-collaborative-fada-reflections-on-the-covid-19-pandemic-and-the-politics-of-social-reproduction/?fbclid=IwAR0YkciFJDNEKco8ZKfhdexFNCvxHFK2ZFUtM3Vz-M1YGxSgVobIYLkx54E" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> feminist principles</a> into politics and the economic system. The power of global corporations and the financial sector have to be drastically reduced through democratic ownership and oversight. The sectors related to basic needs like energy, food, housing, health and education need to be decommodified and definancialised. Economic activity based on cooperation, for example worker cooperatives, has to be fostered.</p>



<p>5) <strong>Base political and economic systems on the principles of solidarity and decolonisation. </strong>Redistribution and justice &#8211;<a href="https://report.gndforeurope.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> transnational, intersectional and intergenerational</a> &#8211; must be the basis for reconciliation between current and future generations, social groups within countries as well as between countries of the Global South and Global North. The Global North in particular must end current forms of exploitation and make reparations for past ones. Climate justice must be the principle guiding a rapid social-ecological transformation. Abandon economic practices that rely on outsourcing cheap labour within and outwith national boundaries, on extractivism and <a href="https://edgeeffects.net/plantationocene-series-plantation-worlds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plantation principles</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Degrowth in Scotland</strong></h4>



<p>While there is a burgeoning and collaborative degrowth network emerging across the globe, there is no such network in Scotland yet, although there are many groups, organisations and campaigns whose work connects with degrowth ideas and principles. We need to come together and work collaboratively to <em>realistically</em> assess projections for Scotland’s social, political and economic future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to mobilise resources required to respond to the climate emergency according to principles of social and environmental justice, livelihoods will need to be reconfigured under different potential governance scenarios, taking into account Brexit and the case for Scottish independence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also recognise that any movement for degrowth must be just: “Unless it is just, it is not degrowth.”’ Scotland must also face its dual role as oppressor and oppressed in the UK’s colonial past. The high rates of Covid-19 deaths among BAME people in the UK are a stark reminder that carrying forth an economic logic that maintains and increases exploitative race and class structures is not an option. <br></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Call to Action</strong></h4>



<p><strong>We call for the following actions in response to these principles:</strong></p>



<p><strong>Convene Citizen Assemblies</strong> across the country to discuss and plan the shift to a degrowth Scotland. These should inform a new economic plan.</p>



<p><strong>Constitute a Special Commission on Degrowth Futures in the Scottish Parliament.</strong> This commission should actively debate the principles and priorities of a postgrowth society actively debate the principles and priorities of a postgrowth<em> society</em>, devise policy alternatives for degrowth futures, and abandon the pursuit of growth as an overarching policy goal. The commission should be open to all and broadcast each day and only call on experts who are committed to real change.</p>



<p><strong>Incorporate alternative indicators into the macroeconomic framework of Scotland. </strong>Economic policies should be evaluated in terms of their impact on human wellbeing, resource use, inequality, and the provision of decent work.<br></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em><strong>Gehan Macleod is one of the people traveling around Europe with our </strong></em><a href="https://www.enough.scot/routes-response/"><em><strong>Routes programme</strong></em></a><em><strong>. Here she describes where she&#8217;s coming from and where&#8217;s shes headed to.</strong></em></p>



<p>Coming from a 90s background in environmental and anti-nuclear activism, I found myself involved in the beginnings of GalGael &#8211; a community organisation that originated around a protest fire at Pollok Free State, an anti motorway camp. Since then I’ve notched up over twenty years experience of wrestling with the challenges in one place, GalGael; in one community; Govan in Glasgow. In many ways that&#8217;s been incredibly varied and I’ve absorbed learning from many lessons, some more painful than others. In a world where relationships can be superficial and transient, it&#8217;s the wrestle of making community of place that has taught me the most. Having grown tired of being anti-stuff, GalGael has been a place where I can explore being for-stuff.</p>



<p>I’ve also kind of had it with rearranging-deck-chairs-on-the-Titanic kind of change, petitions and a lot of the well intentioned change work that goes on &#8211; including increasingly detailed analysis of all that’s going so categorically wrong. I have a hunch this distracts us from our current societal narratives, beliefs, practices and structures &#8211; the assumptive layer that endlessly perpetuates our demise. Illich’s words ring in my ears &#8211; “<em>the present world is built on assumptions we haven’t yet found names for”. </em> This provides a starting point for my Routes journey. In response to the western world we’ve created &#8211; I want to act out. And I want to connect with others who are acting out; acting outwith the current assumptions that constrain our existence, that put a day in day out kind of strain on our souls and debase our humanity; acting outwith the market &#8211; not only surviving but reconceptualising what thriving looks like.</p>



<p>So my journey will seek to connect up with others who are acting out by prototyping new ways of organising society &#8211; away from commodification, around health and compassion, organising support systems within and outwith the state or the institutions already submerged in <a href="http://writingcities.com/2015/11/20/ivan-illichs-tr-conviviality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Illich’s second watershed</a> (two Illich references I know &#8211; expect more!). My Routes journey will seek out those self organising new forms of social security based on mutual aid, practical forms of solidarity in the face of the collapsing systems straddled by our teetering current economic system. Where are others using prefigurative ways of organising that dismantle old norms and prototype new narratives &#8211; where are people already perpetuating the culture shift needed? This journey will take me in to exploring counter cultural spaces and experiences that contribute to greater autonomy or unlearning old patterns as well as exploring practices such as commoning, citizen organising and culture hacking. Traveling by ferry and rail I’ll be looking out for and recording instances where collapsing systems can be seen to interface with the emergence of new possibilities. </p>



<p>I plan to write about the practicalities of traveling without planes. Mostly though I want to share through blog posts and social media thoughts about what we can learn from these experiences and what this says about how to network responses and join up opportunities arising from collapse. Working with the principles of complexity, I want to be open to what I might find and where I might find it. So my plans are loose and still forming. For now though I imagine that they might take me: to France to explore Autonomous Zones such as <em>Le ZAD Zone à Defender Notre-Dame-des-Landes</em> or the refugee camps on the coast; to Ghent to check out the multiplicity of commons related projects; to Utrecth to souch out what’s happening with citizens basic income trial and find out more about their freelance unions. </p>



<p>I look forward to being in conversation with others &#8211; on my journey and back home in Scotland, online and face to face &#8211; staying constantly curious about what precisely it is that these times call for.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the 21st of September 2019, Enough! hosted (in collaboration with <a href="https://bellacaledonia.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bella Caledonia</a> and the <a href="http://www.che.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Centre for Human Ecology</a>) the event <a href="https://www.enough.scot/2019/08/06/deep-adaptation-deep-solidarity/">Deep Adaptation, Deep Solidarity</a> in the Scottish Youth Theatre in Glasgow to explore the following questions:</p>



<p><strong>What does climate breakdown mean for us in practice? </strong></p>



<p><strong>How do our lives need to change to respond to an increasingly unstable and unpredictable future?</strong></p>



<p><strong>How do we ensure that we don’t leave anyone behind?</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.enough.scot/2019/08/06/deep-adaptation-deep-solidarity/">Jem Bendell</a> and <a href="https://www.enough.scot/2019/08/06/deep-adaptation-deep-solidarity/">Gehan Macleod</a> each gave a talk to explore these questions, followed by a discussion chaired by <a href="https://www.enough.scot/2019/08/06/deep-adaptation-deep-solidarity/">layla-roxanne hill</a>.</p>



<p>You can watch the talks below.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>Jem Bendell: </p><p>&#8220;We used to talk about climate change as a problem that would impact upon our grandchildren or possibly our children. &#8230; What we&#8217;ve seen since the summer of 2018 is a shift in perception or a shift in narrative, where people feel that they themselves are in danger.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;With the Deep Adaptation framework, I&#8217;m really inviting people to look at the worst case scenarios, and to support each other in all the difficult emotions that brings up, and actually see how we can turn toward that trouble, stay open to it, inquire into it with curiosity, compassion and respect for each other &#8211; rather than those other tendencies that can happen, which is to just be angry, to look for how to blame someone, and to look for a sense of some kind of psychological or practical safety as quick as possible.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Enough! Welcomes the Programme of Government as an acknowledgement of and commitment to responding to the Climate Emergency.</strong> </p>



<p>The Enough Collective, Scotland&#8217;s new climate and economy think-tank, has issued the following statement on the Scottish Government&#8217;s <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/protecting-scotlands-future-governments-programme-scotland-2019-20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Programme for Government</a> and its climate emergency policies.</p>



<p>Enough! repeats our assertion that any efforts to tackle climate change without talking about economic systems change fundamentally fails to engage with what has caused this crisis and will continue to propel us towards the lived reality of climate breakdown.</p>



<p>Enough! spokesperson Bronagh Gallagher has said: <br><br>&#8220;At this critical time, when our actions now have the chance to significantly mitigate the worst of climate breakdown, it is essential that we do not shy away from naming the uncomfortable truth &#8211; that the economic system which has created a way of life which works for so many is no longer fit for purpose. As long as our economy, at its core, remains oriented towards growth and profit, through resource extraction and increased consumption, all efforts at responding to Climate Emergency will face a contradictory pull towards profits and value maximizing, on the one hand, and sustainability, regeneration and carbon reduction on the other &#8230; we can’t have both.&#8221;</p>



<p>First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has stated that the climate emergency would be the centrepiece of new government legislation and spending:</p>



<p>&#8220;Earlier this year I acknowledged that Scotland, alongside the rest of the world, faces a climate emergency,&#8221; Sturgeon said. &#8220;We have now committed to achieving<a href="https://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/3074978/that-was-quick-scotland-commits-to-2045-net-zero-target" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045 at the latest</a>. That&#8217;s earlier than any other UK nation.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This year&#8217;s Programme for Government is an important part of our response to the climate emergency,&#8221; she added. &#8220;It lays the foundation for a new Scottish Green Deal, with measures to reduce emissions, support sustainable and inclusive growth, promote wellbeing and create a fairer society.&#8221;</p>



<p>The plans announced at Holyrood included significant commitments, including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>A £3bn Green Investment Portfolio</strong></li><li><strong>An £11bn of public procurement money behind the drive to tackle emissions</strong></li><li><strong>A vow to end polluting gas heating in new homes within five years, whilst supporting renewable alternatives</strong></li><li><strong>A&nbsp; package of support for transport, including £500m funding for buses, new money for electric vehicles, a commitment to decarbonise the public sector fleet by 2025, and iconic commitments to decarbonise domestic flights by 2040 and rail by 2035.</strong></li><li><strong>Green city region deals</strong></li><li><strong>Decarbonisation as primary mission of Scottish National Investment Bank</strong></li></ul>



<p>The most positive aspects of these announcements is the sense in which it introduces the idea of structural change: the notion of public procurement being steered by the climate crisis and the Scottish National Investment Bank having decarbonisation as its primary mission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, while the programme has its merits, it does seem to still be operating as if the climate crisis is something that can be dealt with as another policy portfolio. Most of this remains a palliative and piecemeal response. All of the latest scientific data suggests that we are far beyond the point in which adaptive measures are sufficient.<br><br>At the heart of these policies there is still a set of glaring contradictions. As Richard Dixon of Friends of the Earth Scotland has highlighted, the Scottish Government is sticking to its policy of Maximising Economic Recovery from North Sea oil and gas instead of getting serious about the managed phase out of extraction and implementing a just transition for the workers and communities dependent on this sector.</p>



<p>Transport is at the heart of much of what has been announced. But while there are commitments on rail and aviation electrification there is too little on reducing car traffic as an immediate priority.</p>



<p>Equally, on aviation, there is a plan to make the Scottish Highlands and Islands the world&#8217;s first zero emission aviation region, with testing of zero emission flight technology beginning in 2021. But where is the plan to reduce flying starting immediately? Where is the leadership to encourage people to stop flying and to completely re-make and re-imagine our lives?</p>



<p><strong>Where is the national energy descent plan?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Where is the credible Just Transition process that includes large-scale public investment in renewables?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Where is the commitment to abandon fossil fuels?</strong><br></p>



<p>It is a positive that the Scottish Government thinks it is putting climate at the heart of its policies, but in reality in cannot claim to be doing this until it commits at the same time to transforming our economy. </p>



<p>The emphasis on technological solutions is an outdated and retrograde approach when all of the evidence shows us that it is our economic activity and our resource exploitation that are at the heart of our climate crisis.</p>



<p>Enough! Spokesperson Svenja Meyerricks has said: </p>



<p>”What we need is a commitment to degrowth and an abandonment of the market approaches which have brought us to the precipice and which we know will fail. This commitment must dig down deep into the fabric of society and the ways in which we live and work. We must not fail and punish the young for the times of crisis they&#8217;ve been born into; intergenerational environmental justice must be at the heart of climate emergency plans. This means a 100% employment target through a three day work week and localised economies. It also means tackling inequality from the ground up, and prioritising food security through agroecology in land use planning and policies.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Programme for Government is full of good initiatives and perhaps the first tentative steps towards what it would look like to have co-ordinated action operating at scale. But it is still a government committed to a growth economy frightened to explain to people the scale of the changes required to respond to our crisis.</p>



<p>Enough! urge the Scottish Government to demonstrate true global leadership in responding to our climate emergency by committing to transforming the nature of our economy to one which is circular and focuses on well-being. We note the upcoming IPCC report will signify this, also. </p>



<p>With an economy that is oriented towards reduced consumption, reduced resource use and focussed on being in balance with our natural world and enhancing well-being for all our citizens, legislation, public services and industry will have a new north star. Economic systems change is the scale of the response appropriate to the scale of the challenge.<br></p>



<p>Over the coming weeks, Enough! Will be publishing more specific responses and action on how to respond to a Climate Emergency through changing our economic systems.</p>

<p><strong>Professor Jem Bendell</strong> originated the concept of Deep Adaptation to help people  explore individual and collective responses to the future collapse of  society due to climate chaos. His research paper on the topic has been  downloaded over half a million times and is widely credited with  influencing the founders of the Extinction Rebellion protest movement,  which Professor Bendell advises. An author of many books, papers and UN  reports on aspects of sustainable development, Bendell now focuses on  supporting people from various professions to explore our challenging  predicament. In particular, through the free Deep Adaptation Forum &#8211; <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.deepadaptation.info/" target="_blank">www.deepadaptation.info</a></p>

<p><strong>Gehan Macleod</strong> comes from a 90s background in environmental and  anti-nuclear activism &#8211; which lead to her involvement in co-founding the  GalGael Trust, an organisation that originated around a protest fire at  Pollok  Free State, an anti motorway camp. Growing tired of being  anti-stuff &#8211;  for the last twenty years, she’s been caught up with being  for-stuff at&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.galgael.org" target="_blank">GalGael</a>&nbsp;&#8211;   a working community based in Glasgow that makes, decides and learns   together. She’s kind of had it with rearranging-deck-chairs-on-the-Titanic kind of change and, so for now she collects and hoards half-formed notions that suggest a more effective use of energy in the face of all that is going down. This  includes: approaches informed by solidarity and love; systems thinking;  pondering the nature of power; or exploring countercultural and  prefigurative ways of organising that dismantle old norms and prototype  new narratives… ways that will perpetuate the culture shift needed.&nbsp;@gehan_macleod</p>
