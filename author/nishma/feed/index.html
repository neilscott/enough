<p>by Nish Doshi</p>



<p>“Why is environmentalism so white?” With well over a decade in and out of the climate movement in the UK, this is a question I’ve often been asked, and it’s a question that makes me cringe a little. Climate change isn’t an environmental issue, in my opinion, it’s an issue of human rights. It’s borne out of a broken system &#8211; a system that has casually put profit and resource accumulation before people.  </p>



<p>I became aware of climate change at a
young age. I’d grown up in Kenya, and at 12, we were hit with a
<a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/kenya/kenya-country-update-22-sep-2000-kenyas-drought-no-sign-any-let" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major
drought</a>. The result was devastating for the majority
of the population. As a middle class kid growing up in Nairobi, I
didn’t experience the worst of it &#8211; only water shortages and
electricity rationing (due to Kenya’s dependence on
hydroelectricity at the time). But for the rest of the country &#8211; this
meant famine, poverty and mass displacement. The impact of climate
change was visible. It was right in front of us. 
</p>



<p>Instead of centering the lives of those most impacted &#8211; like the destitution of the Turkana peoples &#8211; Kenya’s response was to protect the middle classes from further disruption. They built coal power plants. Aid poured in from the global north, with programmes designed to transform pastoral systems. Tackling the root causes of climate change was not on the agenda.</p>



<p>As a child, I couldn’t understand why. Why weren’t we talking about an end to fossil fuels? But I’d already witnessed the 1998 bombings of the American Embassy in Kenya, and that experience had taught me that all lives which weren’t protected by the global north were expendable in the eyes of the American Empire.</p>



<p>In Kenya, environmentalism meant
National Parks. It meant protecting elephants from poachers hungry
for ivory. It meant mass tourist safaris. It didn’t mean the lives
of every day people. It didn’t mean the lives of groups like the
Ogiek who had been removed from their lands so these National Parks
could be built. And it certainly didn’t mean the lives of poor
rural communities whose lives had been devastated by drought and
flash flooding.</p>



<p>So when people ask me “why is
environmentalism so white?” when referring to the mass
demonstrations against climate change in the UK, I like to answer
that it is because they see climate change as an issue of
‘environmentalism’ rather than an issue of social justice. <br>
<br>
It
is with ‘Climate Justice’ in sight that I have planned my journey
as part of the Routes section of the Enough! project. 
</p>



<p>Through my travels, I hope to show you how our many social justice campaigns and struggles are interconnected with climate justice. From migrant rights to anti-gentrification and safe housing projects. My focus will be on People of Colour (racialised people) and their spaces of resistance and resilience, as we are so often left on the sidelines when it comes to any discussion of climate change in mainstream and activist spaces. I will also introduce you to groups who are actively trying to change that &#8211; centering race and global north/south divides in their work.</p>



<p>I am starting in Barcelona, where I
have already started conversations on issues ranging from migrant
rights, decolonisation, feminism, to housing rights and reclaiming
public spaces. From there, I move onto the Czech Republic to share
stories of Romani and Czech communities working together to fight
gentrification in an old coal mining town which still faces toxic
pollution from nearby chemical factories. After that I’ll be
meeting folks from Berlin who have been actively working on creating
spaces for people of colour in the climate movement. I’ll move onto
the Netherlands &amp; Brussels where we’ll hear from a number of
activists working on decolonising climate change and reclaiming
‘climate justice’ as part of their movements.</p>



<p>I cannot tell you exactly what I expect
to encounter in each of these spaces; I hope they will tell you
instead. The stories I share &#8211; here and on Instagram &#8211; will be ones
that the people have chosen to share with me.</p>



<p>Until then, feel free to send me tips
and share stories! 
</p>



<p>Ciao! 
</p>

<p><br><em><strong>Nishma Doshi travelled around Europe with our </strong></em><a href="https://www.enough.scot/routes-response/"><em><strong>Routes programme</strong></em></a><em><strong>. Here they describe how fighting for housing rights is a part of climate justice in Barcelona.</strong></em></p>



<p><br>What is climate justice? What are we fighting for when we talk about stopping climate change?</p>



<p>Climate breakdown is a problem because it threatens our lives. It threatens our lives because it makes the world around us inhospitable, to us and to other species. It means losing our homes, access to clean water, access to good nutritious food, access to all our basic needs.</p>



<p>So when we are fighting for survival &#8211; which is what stopping climate change is about &#8211; we are fighting for our basic needs. We are fighting for healthy lives; we are fighting for the continued access to our basic needs. That&#8217;s ultimately what climate justice is about. It&#8217;s about an globally equal and equitable access to that which gives us life.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why one of my stops in Barcelona was at the <a href="http://labase.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">La Base: Ateneu Co-operatiu</a>, where the <a href="http://sindicatdebarri.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sindicat de barri del Poble Sec</a> (the neighbourhood union for the Poble Sec area) were having their weekly assembly. </p>



<p>Across Barcelona, different neighbourhoods (barris) have collectively organised to stop evictions and protect basic housing rights. Poble Sec is of particular interest as it is relatively small neighbourhood with a diverse population; residents come from across Europe, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador and Pakistan &#8211; as well as local Catalans.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The weekly meetings</h3>



<p>The sindicat meets once a week on Monday night. There, they discuss general strategies for upcoming political issues as well as provide support for community cases. Folks with cases &#8211; largely related to housing &#8211; drop their names in a jar at the beginning of the meeting, and after the strategy session ends, those names are pulled out, they get a chance to state their case, and assembly members collectively suggest support and solutions. </p>



<p>To be more inclusive, the meetings are held in Spanish (Castellano) as many of the migrants from Latin America do not speak Catalan. This is quite an important compromise made as many Catalans refuse to speak Castellano as a voice of dissent against the Spanish government which has repeatedly, and violently, repressed Catalonia&#8217;s demand for independence &#8211; as we are witnessing right now.</p>



<p>As I don&#8217;t speak Castellano or Catalan, I was kindly invited to the assembly by one of the sindicat&#8217;s members &#8211; Lorenzo. While the original aim of the sindicat was to deal with many political issues, he tells me, most of the actual organising work ends up being around housing as that is what is most urgent. Evictions are common due to rent rises, and increased property speculation. Most cases that come to the sindicat are related to evictions.</p>



<p>With Barcelona increasingly building its economy around tourism, property speculation in popular areas &#8211; like the city centre &#8211; is rampant. Airbnb** has also become a problem, with an increasing amount of flats and spare bedrooms used for temporary tourists rather than for local community housing. </p>



<p>There are also issues around rights to rent for those without the right papers &#8211; that can mean rights of residency to landlords requiring long-term job contracts. Many migrants feel caught in a trap: without rights of residency it is hard to find a job; and without a job it is impossible to rent a space in order to acquire rights of residency. This can be a problem for EU migrants too.</p>



<p>The meetings are organised in a circle (as far as possible) &#8211; with members volunteering for different roles each week. These roles can be &#8220;Masters of Ceremony&#8221; to childcare to welcoming new members. Fragments of the meeting which were translated to me were decisions on how to show solidarity with another barri eviction to how to respond to the sentences placed on Catalan leaders pushing for independence. It is observable how most of the strategy section engages more of the ethnic Catalan activists, while the racialised people* remain mostly quiet. <br><br>The case work is particularly interesting &#8211; and this is really where the issues of the immigrant population are raised. Once a name is called from the jar, that person either states their problem or gives an update on their case. Members of the community then give their advice and expertise. If needs be, the community will come together and stop an eviction or campaign together to challenge a landlord or the municipal government.</p>



<p>It is also important to note that, of the racialised people in attendence, almost all were women. I was told that women are often left with the responsibility of seeking help/support, especially in issues of housing and the family. This work is deeply gendered, with the majority of the responsibility falling on women.</p>



<p>Furthermore there is a visible divide between the racialised peoples in the space and the white activists &#8211; the latter seem to hold most of the organisational responsibility. One of them &#8211; Dan &#8211; also pointed out this distinction, calling it a unintentional &#8220;hierarchy&#8221;.</p>



<p>Obviously some work needs to be done to bridge these divides still. As I travelled and spoke to more people in Barcelona, this was an issue that was brought up over and over again. And it&#8217;s also been an issue I&#8217;ve observed in Scotland too. </p>



<p>In my experience, this often comes to how a space is run &#8211; the norms of the organisation can be &#8216;foreign&#8217; to those who have no direct experience of this kind of organising before.  And example of these norms could be consensus decision making or rotating roles. These norms are often uncritically accepted into organisational structures with no real space for reform or explorations of alternatives.</p>



<p>This makes it difficult for those of us who don&#8217;t fully embrace or feel part of anarchist organising to feel distanced or ostracised from the project. We are always working in ways which are culturally suited for our white colleagues and not really for us or the communities we come from. A longer discussion on community organising methods which centres the experiences of marginalised and racialised people seems really necessary if we want to overcome these divides.<br></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">La Base: Ateneu Co-operatiu</h3>



<p>La Base was formed after the Indignados movement, when people felt it was necessary to have infrastructure and access to amenities in order to organise for change.</p>



<p>The space has meeting rooms, a daily kitchen co-operative which serves up an affordable lunch, a workspace for basic building and repairs, a feminist collective, and a number of other projects apart from the sindicat. The projects provide local employment and benefits local companies and businesses.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Housing Justice is Climate Justice</h3>



<p>Hurricane Katrina destroyed the lives of so many people, houses were flooded and washed away. But the oak trees remained. They stood tall and weathered the storm because their roots were intertwinned. Of the over 700 oak trees in New Orleans, only 40 died. The rest held on.<br><br>As we saw with Katrina, responses to the catastrophic effects of climate change are deeply racialised. Black working class communities are still not getting the support they need.</p>



<p>As Clara-Luisa Weichelt and Julieta Perucca explain:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>&#8220;Governments worldwide fail to provide safe housing and basic infrastructure for a massive amount of people – and the challenges are increasing. People are frequently driven to live in informal settlements by environmental factors, such as natural disasters or environmental degradation that tend to happen more frequently due to climate change. But, the settlements to which they migrate also place them at risk: Nonresistant houses on land that is at risk of flooding, storm surges, mudslides, earthquakes, or contaminated sites, close to roads, waste and/or factories, is more likely to be vacant and is less likely to be contested for investment or development. The lack of basic infrastructure as access to drinking water, health provision, sewage systems, electricity and education as well as the lack of political and social recognition further exacerbates their vulnerability.&#8221;</p><cite><a href="https://www.habitants.org/news/global_info/the_nexus_between_the_right_to_housing_and_climate_change_insights_from_the_climate_conference_cop24_in_katowice_poland" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Nexus between the Right to Housing and Climate Change</a> – Insights from the Climate Conference COP24 in Katowice, Poland, (Thursday 10 January 2019)</cite></blockquote>



<p>Adequate housing rights for all, especially the marginalised in essential in preventing the worst impacts of climate change. Given the failure of governments to meet these basic needs, it has become essential that communities organise together to defend their rights.</p>



<p>If we want to survive what climate change is throwing at us now, as well as in the future, we need to find ways to supporting each other. The sindicat de barri del Poble Sec is one way which people are building connections and working together to deal with housing insecurity. While it&#8217;s not perfect, it&#8217;s providing many people with the support that they need; support that prevents them from ending up homeless and on the street.</p>



<p></p>



<p>*In Spain, People of Colour (PoC) or Black, Indigenous and People of Colour (BIPOC) are not used. The word commonly used translates as &#8220;racialised people&#8221;. This is because the process of Spain&#8217;s colonisation was dissimilar to that of British colonialism, and thus racial categories are different. <br>** While Spain has passed a law requiring all Airbnbs to pay taxes, EU data protection laws allow Airbnb to not disclose who is renting a room through the service. This means that the government struggles to enforce the tax. (This has been further impacted by a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/airbnb-wins-legal-victory-as-top-eu-court-defines-firm-as-information-society-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent EU court ruling</a> that has declared Airbnb not a real estate company)</p>
