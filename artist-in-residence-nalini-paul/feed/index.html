					<description><![CDATA[Dear Nalini Paul
I hope you don&#039;t mind my contacting you in this way. 
A good number of years ago you submitted a story called &#039;Cold&#039; for the then new Toulmin Prize, offered through the Elphinstone Institute  of the University of Aberdeen. I wonder if the story was ever published. I am asking because I&#039;m charged with putting together a little book of stories that have been entered for the competition. I know that &#039;Cold&#039; didn&#039;t win the prize in 2008 (personally, I think that it should, but I wasn&#039;t a judge then) but I would like to include it in this publication. 
Do let me know.
Thank you. Take care.
