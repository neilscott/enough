	<description>Enough! is an informal collective of activists in Scotland who have come together to take action on challenging our dominant economic system. We believe that inequality, oppression, injustice, power and ecological breakdown are all connected by the same story:</description>

					<description><![CDATA[It seems ....Kicking against the pricks.....is not rebelling against authority but instead realising when to stop the actions and behaviors that perpetuate pain and decline ....and make alternative choices that lead to wellbeing.

How to engage the many in making new choices?

&quot;Play your part in the greatest story ever told, THE reality show!&quot;  

Evolution not revolution - using existing structures to inform, involve , inspire change

Simplicity is a virtue - communicate 10 things that can be different and their positive consequences for me and/or you and/or others 

When we reach each tipping point, when the many choose differently, the systems and structures will evolve accordingly

It can be a ripple effect but how to  make the first wave in a community of significant scale and sufficient platform for others to be inspired ?........Scotland!   
Choose to no longer be a garden in a forest that the world will never see!]]></description>
