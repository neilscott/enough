					<description><![CDATA[It seems ....Kicking against the pricks.....is not rebelling against authority but instead realising when to stop the actions and behaviors that perpetuate pain and decline ....and make alternative choices that lead to wellbeing.

How to engage the many in making new choices?

&quot;Play your part in the greatest story ever told, THE reality show!&quot;  

Evolution not revolution - using existing structures to inform, involve , inspire change

Simplicity is a virtue - communicate 10 things that can be different and their positive consequences for me and/or you and/or others 

When we reach each tipping point, when the many choose differently, the systems and structures will evolve accordingly

It can be a ripple effect but how to  make the first wave in a community of significant scale and sufficient platform for others to be inspired ?........Scotland!   
Choose to no longer be a garden in a forest that the world will never see!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Nalini Paul
I hope you don&#039;t mind my contacting you in this way. 
A good number of years ago you submitted a story called &#039;Cold&#039; for the then new Toulmin Prize, offered through the Elphinstone Institute  of the University of Aberdeen. I wonder if the story was ever published. I am asking because I&#039;m charged with putting together a little book of stories that have been entered for the competition. I know that &#039;Cold&#039; didn&#039;t win the prize in 2008 (personally, I think that it should, but I wasn&#039;t a judge then) but I would like to include it in this publication. 
Do let me know.
Thank you. Take care.

I would like to hear from you.]]></description>
