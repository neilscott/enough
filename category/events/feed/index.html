<p>There is much talk about ‘Green Economy’ or ‘Green Growth’ as the main solution to climate change. In this teach-in we will examine the fundamental problems of the narratives of Green Growth, how it is preserving a status quo that will further accelerate climate breakdown. In the second part, we’ll take a look at Degrowth as an alternative for a just and social transformation of our society.</p>

<p>Degrowth, while a general critique of our global state of affairs, is fundamentally a situated approach and makes sense for the Global South as an anti-colonial project. Green Growth is pushed as a new language of imperialism in places like Chile and in “energy transitions” initiatives. This teach-in highlights the resistance to the “growth at all costs” that emerges from communities defending their territories and different cosmologies and frames degrowth as a project of global solidarity and human needs.</p>

<p>Enough! is going to host the sub-theme session <strong>&#8220;The Scottish Degrowth Commission: work, livelihoods and a ‘just transition’&#8221;</strong> with Svenja Meyerricks and Ewan Mackenzie at the <a href="http://www.confercare.manchester.ac.uk/events/degrowth2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joint conference of the International Degrowth Research Network and the International Society for Ecological Economics</a> on 5th &#8211; 8th July 2021. <br /><br />‘The Scottish Degrowth Commission’ is a panel discussion to explore how degrowth ideas and practices can influence ideas to restore people’s work and livelihoods in Scotland in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic and its economic fallout. The concept of a ‘just transition’,used by climate justice campaigns in relation to the pandemic and its aftermath, is useful when considering ways forward to restore and reconfigure people’s livelihoods by redistributing work and shifting industries towards those compatible with ecological restoration and zero carbon practices. See our <a href="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Enough-Open-Call-Degrowth-Conference-Session.pdf">open call for contributions</a> for more information. <br /><br /><strong>Submission guidelines:</strong> Please send abstracts to svenja@enough.scot and ewan.mackenzie@newcastle.ac.uk by the 31st of May 2021. Contributions are welcomed from anyone with experience or ideas in the above topics. We invite the sharing of ideas in any form &#8211; creative and innovative forms of presentation are welcome. We will also have two additional online sessions: a warming up session where presenters can meet, and a follow-up ‘meet and greet’ session where participants will be invited after the main event. <br /><br />Each presenter will be funded by Enough! to cover the conference fees in order to attend the online conference.</p>

<p>This course has been developed collaboratively by CHE, Enough!, Lorenzo Velotti and Martin Krobath, working according to co-operative values. We are making the handbook freely available to all under a Creative Commons licence. The production of the course content has required a substantial amount of research, design, delivery and resources. We wish to &#8216;practice what we preach&#8217; with regards to a course that examines degrowth economics and as such, no one will be prevented from accessing the course for financial reasons. At the same time, we uphold the value of academic labour and knowledge creation, and ask participants to discern how they are able to help sustainably resource this kind of work, within the limits of our current exchange economy and a pandemic downturn. As such, we are offering several levels of suggested course fee contributions, and invite you to consider the level most suitable to you. All income from this course will go towards our co-operative educational and charitable work.</p>

<p>£200- Solidarity<br>This rate is for those with access to organisational training budgets, sufficient income, or who wish to financially support the course and our work. It&#8217;s also a rate in solidarity with those who are participating who are not able to make a financial contribution.</p>



<p>£150- Waged<br>This rate is for those on an average income or above who are in the position to cover approximately the full per-person delivery cost of the course.</p>



<p>£80- Concessions<br>This rate is for those on a below-average income who are in the position to make a contribution which will cover around half the per-person delivery cost of the course.</p>



<p>FREE or pay what you can &#8211;<br>This rate is for those who, for any reason whatsoever, are not in the position to make contributions at the above rates. Any financial contribution is valued- if you sincerely cannot at this time, this is not a barrier to your participation.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"> <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/130908-anna-hibiscus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anna Hibiscus – Atinuke</a></strong>, 6 years+</h4>



<p>There  are many, many Anna Hibiscus books both as picture books and short,  early reader chapter books. Written by Nigerian-born  story teller Atinuke, the stories follow a young child, Anna Hibiscus  on her adventures. Anna is part of a mixed race family living in  “amazing Africa”. The same author has written amonther series called  “The No.1 Car Spotter” which follows Oluwalase Babatunde Benson, the no.1 car spotter in his rural village in an undisclosed country in Africa. Both series of  books are light-hearted and fun and ideal as first chapter books to read alone.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/275966-agent-zaiba-investigates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Agent Zaiba Investigates – Annabelle Sami,</a> 6 years+</h4>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36635202-lightning-girl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lightening Girl – Alesha Dixon, 8 years+</a></h4>



<p>Part of a series of books  about 10 year old Aurora Beam who discovers she has secret powers whilst  sticking up for her little sister in the school  playground. She later learns her mum is secretly a superhero and has to  work out how to balance her everyday life with her newfound powers.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/41710162-asha-the-spirit-bird" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Asha and the Spirit Bird – Jasbinder Bilan</a>, 8 years+</h4>



<p>The story follows a young  girl, Asha, travelling from her home in the foothills of the Himalayas  to find her father who has gone to earn some money  in a far off city. The subject matter is dark at times but the tone is  constantly reassuring and has a magical, fairy tales quality. </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39884333-the-boy-at-the-back-of-the-class" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Boy at The Back Of The Class – Onjali Q Rauf</a>, 8 years +</h4>



<p>Told from the perspective of a  9-and-nearly-three-quarter year old, The Boy at The Back of the Class  follows four friend who tried to befriend and  then help the enigmatic new boy who sits at the back of their class.  This book expertly explores difficult issues around the refugee crisis,  losing a parent and navigating the confusing world of politics in an  entirely age appropriate way. There is such humour  and tenderness throughout.</p>



<p>For upper primary, many of  the books featuring characters of colour, disabled characters and LGBT  characters are issues based. While this can be  helpful, it’s also necessary for children to read stories with diverse  characters not simple overcoming barriers. My children have found that  crime fiction is one genre that seems to do well in terms of  representation so our recommendations are quite weighted  towards detective stories. </p>

<p>Malorie Blackman has written numerous books with  BAME characters for new readers to young adults but her most well-known  series, and most likely to be found in any high school library is the  Noughts and Crosses series. The population is divided into two: the white Noughts are second-class  citizens, and the black Crosses are highly-revered and perceived as the  superior race. 15-year-old Callum is a Nought, and his best friend,  Sephy, as well as being a Cross, is also the daughter  of one of the most influential politicians in the country. </p>

 a moving portrait of a clever, talented girl who is gradually falling

<p>This is a gritty, urban mystery touching on the 
dangerous reality of drug pushing and young people being forced into 
dealing. It’s a pacey, crime thriller looking at serious issues without 
preaching.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34728667-children-of-blood-and-bone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Children of Blood and Bone &#8211; Tomi Adeyemi</a>, 14 years+</h4>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Ms Marvel, Spiderman (Miles Moralis) and a number of other Marvel superheroes.</h4>



<p>A smattering of Marvel superheroes in the last five years have been racially diverse,  well-rounded, complex characters. My personal favourite is  Kamila Khan as Ms Marvel, a second-generation Pakistani American  teenager in New Jersey trying, as so many Marvel heroes do, to work out  how to use her powers effectively whilst staying true to herself and her  family’s culture.</p>

April, Mal, Molly and Ripley are five best pals determined to have fun

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3061046/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steven Universe</a></h4>



<p>In Steven Universe the world is protected from evil by the Crystal gems who have escaped from  Homeworld because they were unable to live under the  strict world order imposed by the Diamonds who rule it. As well as  excellent representation, this programme has great music with each of  the main characters assuming a different musical genre. Although there  are battles between the ‘good’ and ‘evil’ forces,  ultimately the only way to win in Steven Universe is through emotional  growth and understanding. </p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7745956/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">She-ra and the Princesses of Power</a></h4>



<p>A contemporary re-make of the  80’s classic, She-Ra and the Princesses of Power is an openly queer  cartoon for children of all ages that eschews  binaries of all kinds. Even the treatment of good vs’ evil is nuanced  and, as with in Steven Universe, emotional growth is what all the  characters are constantly working towards. </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1825683/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Panther</a></h4>



<p>Set in Wakanda, a small, isolationist, landlocked country in Africa. Two foes conspire to destroy it and superhero Black Panther works with special forces from Wakanda and USA to try and prevent it from being dragged into a world war. Unaccustomed as we are to a majority black cast in a  Hollywood action movie, this film is a such a treat in giving viewers a  range of complex, three-dimensional, Black characters  to watch as well as exploring themes of colonialism and generational  trauma.  </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298228/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whale Rider</a></h4>



<p>Whale Rider tells the story  of a young Maori girl, Pai, who challenges tradition and embraces the  past in order to find the strength to lead her  people forward. Beautifully shot and with incredible performances from  the cast, this is such a wonderful film for children and adults alike.</p>

<p><strong>The following resources are intended for parents, carers, educators and everyone who takes an interest in decolonising educational resources for children. The list has been compiled by Sapna Agarwal for an Upending conversation on the 9th of July 2020, hosted by </strong><a href="https://www.enough.scot/"><strong>Enough! Scotland </strong></a><strong>with support from the </strong><a href="http://www.che.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Centre for Human Ecology</strong></a><em>.</em> </p>



<p><em>This list of resources is for young children aged 18 months &#8211; primary school age. We will cover resources for older children and teenagers in subsequent blog posts.</em></p>



<p><strong>Event Synopsis: </strong>Creating a decolonised environment for children to grow up in is not straightforward, especially given that most of us have been socialised within a white supremacist, patriarchal context. This conversation examined the importance of narratives that don’t perpetuate the dominant, capitalist, post-colonialist worldview, looking at examples of helpful and damaging resources available and sharing ideas of how to use your existing materials to promote critical analysis in children of all ages. Brought to you with humility and an understanding that working towards decolonised parenting is not a linear progression, that we are all learning all the time and how much we can learn from each other. <strong>You can watch the full talk </strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPPcPigSs1U&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;fbclid=IwAR2pAA4MAlYK4xVeXGYNPhjG4GAY7EV6Ogo0lUxaatMGBXNgahyCXBdXYCY&amp;app=desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Sapna Agarwal</strong> is a community activist, parent and long-term home educator. She is the founding member of Glasgow’s longest running home education group, a non-hierarchical, all ages, social group based on mutual respect and support. She is also a partner at <a href="https://www.cca-glasgow.com/shop/ayeaye-books" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aye-Aye Books</a>, a radical bookshop based in the CCA, Glasgow. She initiated the children’s section there which stocks books featuring children under-represented on the high street and in mainstream media. </p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096283/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">My Neighbour Totoro.</a></strong> Many of the Studio Ghibli films are great for young children. The  characters tend to be Japanese, tend not to privilege capitalist values  and eschew heteronormative ideas about friendship.</p>

It’s only five or  ten minutes long. More relevant to children  in USA but still valuable to watch from the UK.<br><br></p>

<p>A free creative writing workshop in two parts, with the first taking place on <a href="https://www.degrowth.info/en/2019/06/global-degrowth-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Global Degrowth Day</strong></a>, coinciding with a number of other events that share alternatives to growth based societies. </p>



<p><strong>Saturday 6th June &amp; Sunday 14th June, 8pm &#8211; 9:30pm</strong><br><br><strong>Spaces are limited &#8211; you can book yours </strong><a href="https://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/4605960" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong> We&#8217;d like to encourage you to take part in both days. If that&#8217;s not possible, please let us know at info@enough.scot.</p>



<p><strong>Workshop Info: </strong>A range of challenges designed to stimulate the imagination will allow participants to find fun and unexpected ways to tell stories and express ideas around degrowth in our troubled times. We use words as a tool for inspiration, delight and hope to reflect on some of our ways of being together in the world, and share our findings. The inspiration behind the workshop comes from a broad theoretical background, from Donna Haraway to Doughnut Economics and the Work that Reconnects. Participants have the option to have their stories and poems published on the Enough! blog or in the form of a zine. </p>



<p><strong>Juana Adcock</strong> is a poet, translator and performer. Her Spanish-language poetry collection, Manca, explores the anatomy of violence in the Mexican drug war and was named by Reforma‘s distinguished critic Sergio González Rodríguez as one of the best books published in 2014. In 2016 she was named one of the ‘Ten New Voices from Europe’ by Literature Across Frontiers, and she has performed at numerous literary festivals internationally. Her English-language debut, Split (Blue Diode Press, 2019) was awarded the Poetry Book Society Choice.</p>



<p>This workshop is supported by the <a href="http://www.che.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Centre for Human Ecology</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The coronavirus pandemic is a reminder that health is truly a public issue that we must meet with care, courage and a collaborative mindset in order to lessen the impact on everyone, but especially on the hardest hit and most vulnerable members of society.</p>



<p>The best case scenario would be a well-resourced public health system and carefully coordinated responses by our national governments and local authorities that enable us to restructure our daily lives in ways that minimise the risk of infection and ensuing spread of the virus.</p>



<p>This is not our current reality. Years of austerity politics have left the NHS and local authorities woefully underfunded and ill-equipped to meet the demands that the peak of the coronavirus outbreak will bring. The UK Government’s light-handed approach in the hope to increase “herd immunity” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/epidemiologist-britain-herd-immunity-coronavirus-covid-19?CMP=share_btn_fb&amp;fbclid=IwAR1oB1ZsbwDN-m_IzbT0OS5ylIG2-3dgOXpicNw5xJnhTkL1iVar5jlNgKM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been widely criticised by experts</a> and those based in other countries where the outbreak is already more advanced than here. The Scottish Government’s<a href="https://www.gov.scot/news/covid-19-testing-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> introduction of community testing</a> to monitor how the virus spreads to better predict when it is likely to peak is an important move. However, measures to limit the spread of the virus are not yet far-reaching given that we are dealing with a global emergency unfolding at an exponential pace.</p>



<p>We are also very wary of the narrative that there are positive environmental consequences as a result of the coronavirus. Celebrating the carbon reduction brought from the virus distracts us from the kind of systemic change that is desperately needed. We’ve been needing to slow down for a long time:</p>



<p>“What the virus is telling us about our society, our work life, our family life, our systems is this: most of it isn’t designed for humans, it’s designed for capitalism. That’s a profound insight worth holding onto.” &#8211; <a href="https://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2020/03/15/on-isolation-and-recovery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mike Small</a></p>



<p>At this time of social emergency, what can we learn towards making systemic change? We can acknowledge the vital importance of our public services, reflect on the importance of community and human connection, recognise our collective interdependence and be conscious of our creative potential. We can make the most of this time to take stock, to read and learn, to <a href="https://usdac.us/news-long/2020/3/15/community-care-in-the-time-of-coronavirus?fbclid=IwAR27JEIBFgm0mSteqv5U7L9iadGnJ9loX3tv5hz9gP-QB1EY2t2nfqtd9lo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">share resources</a>, to explore, discuss and build alternatives.</p>



<p><strong><em>Together, we are enough. Together, we can find ways to move through times of crisis and beyond. </em></strong></p>



<p>We must now look at routes available to us to strengthen mutual support 
structures for the most vulnerable in society and our public health 
system. Taking collective responsibility is one way in which each of us 
can help to “<a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/dragging-out-the-coronavirus-epidemic-is-important-in-saving-lives" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flatten the curve</a>”
 of the pandemic’s peak in Scotland and the UK, and minimise the impact 
on people needing treatment, and on our overstrained and under resourced
 NHS and its workers.</p>



<p>At Enough!, we have made the decision to move our internal meetings and public-facing events to virtual spaces for the time being. This will cut down on commuting and sharing spaces in close proximity, to slow down the virus outbreak. In terms of our planned outward facing work, this will affect the <a href="https://www.enough.scot/2020/02/24/less-for-lent-give-up-capitalism-for-40-days/">Less for Lent</a> group meet-ups and the launch of <a href="https://www.enough.scot/2019/10/10/less/">Less &#8211; the journal of the Scottish Degrowth Commission, Issue 1</a>, which are both to take place in the coming weeks and which we are now looking to host in virtual spaces. </p>



<p>The decision might also mean prioritising research and development in the coming weeks and maybe months, which won’t affect our publications but has some implications for our community-based work. We will move as much as we possibly can onto virtual platforms, and will share information on how to join and connect with us on a case by case basis.</p>



<p>We recognise that we are lucky to be in a position to take these steps, and we would like to encourage those who can to take similar measures. </p>



<p>We can reframe ‘social distancing’ as an <a href="https://mailchi.mp/c51680b37a33/march-in-mayday-rooms-2682841?e=0b5a67bf1c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">act of solidarity</a> and mutual aid. We recognise that the act of self-isolation may be difficult for many in a world already marked with loneliness, alienation, fear and social insecurity. We would like to set a precedent of care for our friends, neighbours and those around us: we encourage everyone to think about how we can act collectively to protect marginalised and oppressed groups, to connect and deepen community over the next few weeks.</p>



<p>In solidarity and care,<br></p>



<p>Enough!</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>Jem Bendell: </p><p>&#8220;We used to talk about climate change as a problem that would impact upon our grandchildren or possibly our children. &#8230; What we&#8217;ve seen since the summer of 2018 is a shift in perception or a shift in narrative, where people feel that they themselves are in danger.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;With the Deep Adaptation framework, I&#8217;m really inviting people to look at the worst case scenarios, and to support each other in all the difficult emotions that brings up, and actually see how we can turn toward that trouble, stay open to it, inquire into it with curiosity, compassion and respect for each other &#8211; rather than those other tendencies that can happen, which is to just be angry, to look for how to blame someone, and to look for a sense of some kind of psychological or practical safety as quick as possible.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><br><em>Ahead of our meeting with Jem Bendell later this month in Glasgow &#8216;</em><a href="https://www.enough.scot/2019/08/06/deep-adaptation-deep-solidarity/"><em>Deep Adaptation,. Deep Solidarity&#8217;</em></a><em> here is an introduction to some of the ideas and approaches behind Deep Adaptation (see also </em><a href="http://insight.cumbria.ac.uk/id/eprint/4776/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>&#8220;Because it’s not a drill: technologies for deep adaptation to climate chaos&#8221;</em></a><em> downloadable here as a PDF).</em></p>



<p>As people begin to discuss what “Deep  Adaptation” could mean (and what it doesn’t), we wish to clarify some  core ideas that have been expressed in more <a href="https://jembendell.wordpress.com/2019/01/09/hope-and-vision-in-the-face-of-collapse-the-4th-r-of-deep-adaptation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detail elsewhere</a>.</p>



<p>Deep Adaptation refers to the personal and collective changes that 
might help us to prepare for – and live with – a climate-induced 
collapse of our societies. Unlike mainstream work on adaptation to 
climate change, it doesn’t assume that our current economic, social, and
 political systems can be resilient in the face of rapid climate change.
 When using the term social or societal collapse, we are referring the 
uneven ending to our current means of sustenance, shelter, security, 
pleasure, identity and meaning. Others may prefer the term societal 
breakdown when referring to the same process. We consider this process 
to be inevitable, because of our view that humanity will not be able to 
respond globally fast enough to protect our food supplies from chaotic 
weather. People who consider that societal collapse or breakdown is 
either possible, likely or already unfolding, also are interested in 
deep adaptation.</p>



<p>Four questions guide our work on Deep Adaptation:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Resilience: what do we most value that we want to keep and how?</strong></li><li><strong>Relinquishment: what do we need to let go of so as not to make matters worse?</strong></li><li><strong>Restoration: what could we bring back to help us with these difficult times?</strong></li><li><strong>Reconciliation: with what and whom shall we make peace as we awaken to our mutual mortality?</strong></li></ul>



<p>These questions invite exploration of Deep Adaptation to our climate 
predicament in order to develop both collapse-readiness and 
collapse-transcendence.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Collapse-readiness includes the mental and material measures that 
will help reduce disruption to human life – enabling an equitable supply
 of the basics like food, water, energy, payment systems and health.</li><li>Collapse-transcendence refers to the psychological, spiritual and 
cultural shifts that may enable more people to experience greater 
equanimity toward future disruptions and the likelihood that our 
situation is beyond our control.</li></ul>



<p>Uncertainty and lack of control are key aspects of our predicament; 
we do not know whether what we do will slow climate change and societal 
collapse or reduce harm at scale. It looks likely to us that many will 
die young and that we may die sooner than we had expected. That does not
 mean we do not try to extend the glide and soften the crash – and learn
 from the whole experience.</p>



<p>One thing that rapid climate change can help us to learn is the 
destructiveness of our delusions about reality and what is important in 
life. Key to this delusion is the emphasis many of us place on our 
separate identities. Since birth we have been invited to “other” people 
and nature. We often assume other people to be less valuable, smart or 
ethical as us. Or we assume we know what they think. We justify that in 
many ways, using stories of nationality, gender, morals, personal 
survival, or simply being “too busy”. Similarly, we have been encouraged
 to see nature as separate from us. Therefore, we have not regarded the 
rivers, soils, forests and fields as part of ourselves. Taken together, 
this othering of people and nature means we dampen any feelings of 
connection or empathy to such a degree that we can justify exploitation,
 discrimination, hostility, violence, and rampant consumption.</p>



<p>Seeking physical and psychological security and pleasure through 
control of our surroundings and how people interact with us is both a 
personal malaise and at the root of our collective malaise. Yet, as we 
see more pain in the world, and sense that it will get worse, it is 
possible that we will shrink from it. It is easier to consider other 
people’s pain as less valid as one’s own pain or that of the people and 
pets we know. But there is another way. The suffering of others presents
 us with an opportunity to feel and express love and compassion. Not to 
save or to fix, but to be open to sensing the pain of all others and 
letting that transform how we live in the world. It does not need to 
lead to paralysis or depression, but to being fully present to life in 
every moment, however it manifests. This approach is the opposite of 
othering and arises from a loving mindset, where we experience universal
 compassion to all beings. It is the love that our climate predicament 
invites us to connect with. <em>It is the love in deep adaptation.</em></p>



<p>Therefore, in our work with others on deep adaptation, we wish to 
pursue and enable loving responses to our predicament. Every interaction
 offers an opportunity for compassion. It can seem difficult when it 
feels as if someone is trying to criticise your view, perhaps because 
they prefer to see collapse as unlikely or human extinction as certain. 
But to return to compassion, even if we fall away from it in the moment,
 feels an important way of living our truth. And it is something we can 
do at any time. As leadership coach Diana Reynolds recently explained, 
“the incredible compassionate revolution starts here, starts now.”</p>



<p>As this topic involves questions of mortality, impermanence,  insecurity and uncontrollability, everyone who is finding themselves  navigating their way through is experiencing many strong emotional  responses, which may feel turbulent, overwhelming, exhausting as well as  energising or enlivening. Often these emotions affect us, including  ourselves and our colleagues, in ways that we may not be aware of.  Therefore in working in the Deep Adaptation, we invite each other to consider three  principles:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Return to compassion. We shall seek to return to universal 
compassion in all our work, and remind each other to notice in ourselves
 when anger, fear, panic, or insecurity may be influencing our thoughts 
or behaviours. It is also important to remember to take care of 
ourselves, especially when the urgency of our predicament can easily 
lead to burnout.</li><li>Return to curiosity. We recognise that we do not have many answers 
on specific technical or policy matters. Instead, our aim is to provide a
 space and an invitation to participate in generative dialogue that is 
founded in kindness and curiosity.</li><li>Return to respect. We respect other people’s situations and however 
they may be reacting to our alarming predicament, while seeking to build
 and curate nourishing spaces for deep adaptation.</li></ul>
