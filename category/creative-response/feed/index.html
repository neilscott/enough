<p><strong>Poem by Juana Adcock. Illustration: Fadzai Mwakutuya; photo: Ewan Bush</strong></p>



<p>This is from #2 of LESS &#8211; our journal of degrowth, radical sufficiency and decolonisation in Scotland. <a href="https://www.enough.scot/less/">Details of how to get a print copy here.</a></p>



<p></p>



<p><em><u>Steel</u></em></p>



<p>I place my palm en la reja called border wall.</p>



<p>Let its steel enter my body: iron alloyed with carbon</p>



<p>hardened to prevent the<em> movement of</em> <em>dislocations.</em></p>



<p>I am in Tijuana, looking at California through the bars</p>



<p>though it isn’t clear where the prison lies.</p>



<p>To my left the bars peter out into an ocean</p>



<p>whose waves refuse to be contained.</p>



<p>The body of an adult human</p>



<p>contains about four grams of iron;</p>



<p>all four of mine rush to meet la reja imantada.</p>



<p>When we speak of magnetism,</p>



<p>we think of love, or charisma,</p>



<p>or crowds of faces all in one direction.</p>



<p>But never of iron as the metal</p>



<p>at the active site of many enzymes</p>



<p>dealing with cellular respiration</p>



<p>or the pull towards a ‘better life’.</p>



<p>Glasgow’s sandstone tenements, incidentally,</p>



<p>are red because they contain iron.</p>



<p>Our blood stone is iron ore.</p>



<p>It emanates its own light.</p>



<p>We are the blood, migrating</p>



<p>bringing cargo</p>



<p>from one cell to the next</p>



<p>keeping the body alive, we transport</p>



<p>mercancía</p>



<p>maquinaria</p>



<p>manos</p>



<p>más.</p>



<p>The iron for the wall was mined in the M states</p>



<p>bordering with Canada.</p>



<p>Not that long ago, the land was cleared</p>



<p>of its people, wildlife and forests.</p>



<p>Migrants from Europe fed the logs down the rivers</p>



<p>laid the train tracks</p>



<p>peeled away life on the topsoil</p>



<p>bloodlet the earth to build</p>



<p>this line of steel</p>



<p>marking the limits of possession.</p>



<p>Praying from Carnegie’s <em>Gospel of Wealth</em></p>



<p>which built an empire of steel</p>



<p>repeating that this was progress</p>



<p>away from universal squalor</p>



<p>we were able to steal our eyes away</p>



<p>from the impoverishment</p>



<p>of the lands</p>



<p>—now empty red pits</p>



<p>gaping red wounds</p>



<p>as far as the eye can see.</p>



<p></p>



<p><em><u>The Letter M</u></em></p>



<p>With a guru’s moustache and a penchant for conspiracy</p>



<p>the madman explains to me that language is a form of mind control</p>



<p>the grammar itself holding us in a bind</p>



<p>– an incantation muttered over millenia</p>



<p>shaping our thoughts.</p>



<p>I want to master the art of the pictogram, he says.</p>



<p>It is the earliest form of writing</p>



<p>is uncontaminated by the misers, the drive for accumulation</p>



<p>created with the rise of agriculture.</p>



<p>The letter M, for example, is the pictogram of a wave</p>



<p>we forget where it comes from, it loses all meaning</p>



<p>we write it over and over without ever thinking of water</p>



<p>or how maritime and motherly,</p>



<p>muro y morada are of one essence.</p>



<p>As he speaks, I watch the surfers glide along the lip of the perfect breakers</p>



<p>almost for the whole line of the horizon</p>



<p>before they topple over into the sea</p>



<p>like tiny plastic soldiers.</p>



<p>That night we slept hearing the waves crash onto the rocks</p>



<p>and in the morning, we knew we were rocks too.</p>



<p>Our hearts, hardened lava.</p>



<p>The Pacific had smoothed round windows through us</p>



<p>and like a Barbara Hepworth sculpture</p>



<p>we were made whole</p>



<p>by what we lack.</p>



<p></p>



<p><em><u>Storylines</u></em></p>



<p>Roads are heavier on the rich side of the line.</p>



<p>Asphalt mixed with cement is whiter</p>



<p>loudening under car wheels, it hardens over time,</p>



<p>requiring little maintenance.</p>



<p>Such are the roads of the first world.</p>



<p>But the dwellings there are transient</p>



<p>wooden-framed and lighter</p>



<p>as if to be filled with</p>



<p>cushions and the crinkle of food wrappers</p>



<p>and some child’s quiet voice in a corner of the room</p>



<p>mouthing</p>



<p>and I’ll huff</p>



<p>and I’ll puff.</p>



<p>On the other side of the line</p>



<p>the asphalt grows crocodile-skinned.</p>



<p>Pockmarked and permeable,</p>



<p>it can cope with earthquakes</p>



<p>and melt in the sun.</p>



<p>Initially it’s cheaper to lay</p>



<p>but has a shorter lifespan.</p>



<p>Such the roads of the third world.</p>



<p>But here, our houses</p>



<p>you can tell by just looking at them</p>



<p>are made of cement, heavy as pyramids</p>



<p>as if to hold us at home</p>



<p>for longer.</p>



<p></p>

<p>For the Enough! residency we would like to introduce ourselves as Verbena Blue Collective; a collective of theatre/arts related professionals whom after working on dictated and closed projects, have decided to create an original, experimental and more open path, which will allow us to create works aligned more closely to our beliefs, convictions and taste.</p>



<p>Verbena Blue Collective aims to break establishment boundaries and seeks alternative options which will respond and address social/political/environmental challenges.</p>



<p>Current members of Verbena Blue Collective are: Leonor Estrada/Co-Director, Paul Kennard/Composer, Coach Anton Vasiliadis/Sound Designer, Dani San Roman &amp; Marta Aspe/Costume, Daniel Stote/Lx Designer, Zane Gray/Stage-Words and Ruben San Roman/Concept-Set Design. </p>

<p>The main aim of our project <strong>Land-Filled</strong>, will be to create a small theatre piece able to address how our current actions as a society are scrupulously linked to the climate change crisis, and, actually will have a knock-on effect in the future.</p>



<p>Hence, we are (re)imagining a time not too far in the future, as a dystopian group who are (re) inventing how human lives have been adapting their direction(s) on a completely collapsed and chaotic surrounding environment.</p>



<p>We have found ourselves drawn to creating awareness of the climate crisis through our research and the mix of music/soundscapes, theatre and storytelling in our practice.</p>



<p>For this reason, <strong>Land-Filled</strong> will engage all sorts of audiences to provoke an immediate response, social action and critical thought.</p>

<p>Nalini Paul’s poetry is inspired by natural landscapes, walks and memory. Born in India, she grew up in Vancouver, Canada, and has been living in Scotland for most of her adult life. She is widely published and has collaborated across various art forms, including stage and film. </p>



<p>She was George Mackay Brown Writing Fellow in Orkney from 2009 until 2010, where she worked with dancers, musicians, visual artists, archaeologists and the RSPB. </p>



<p>Her first poetry pamphlet,&nbsp;Skirlags, was shortlisted for the Callum Macdonald Award in 2010. </p>



<p>Her collection, The Raven’s Song (2015) is inspired by raven and crow myths from Orkney, Shetland and Canada. </p>



<p>Nalini’s poetic work for stage with Stellar Quines Theatre Company, Beyond the Mud Walls, is set partly in 1940s India and was showcased for ‘Rehearsal Rooms’ at the Traverse, Edinburgh, in September 2016. She was a Robert Louis Stevenson Fellow in 2017, spending a month at Grez-sur-Loing, France working on her poetry partly inspired by The Bhagavad Gita. </p>



<p>Nalini undertook a residency in Lewis and Kolkata as part of the ‘New Passages’ project (2017-18), exploring connections between India and Scotland. She currently tutors and lectures at <a href="http://www.nalinipaul.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glasgow School of Art</a>. </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>LANGUAGE, LOSS AND IDENTITY: AN EXPLORATION OF ORKNEY/HIGHLAND STORIES AND MYTHS</strong></h4>



<p>I will be exploring the use of ritual in relation to punishment and reward; and whether these bred myths around regeneration and transformation. Was there a hierarchy of language, which enabled power over individuals/groups? Was there a form of subversion against this domination? (If this is before written language, we can never ‘know’, but we can imagine.)</p>



<p>The framework may be based on oral histories/stories, myths, etc (as opposed to ‘history’).</p>



<p>The research could look to include myths and stories connected to wells in Pictish Scotland (the one in Burghead may have been used for ritual drownings). I will look for connections between these stories and the raven and crow myths which I have explored in my poetry collection, The Raven’s Song (2015), in terms of transformation.</p>



<p><br>I am currently working on an extended piece of fiction (which may include poetry at some stage), exploring the loss of language and literacy, communication, landscape, memory and belonging. </p>



<p>Through metaphor, it aims to subvert existing hierarchies and narratives (of coloniser over colonised subject) by giving voice to the voiceless female protagonist. The landscape (both imagined and lived/real) forms an integral part of the character’s identity.</p>



<p>By focussing on specific physical details of that landscape, one is reminded of the loss of natural spaces (both micro and macro); and I wish to explore the individual’s connection to ‘natural’ landscapes through sensory perceptions and materiality. The physical nature of the landscape (and potentially its ‘thingness’) gives life to the character, echoing the fragility and complexity of the individual and her natural environment.</p>

<p>Jamie is an artist-printmaker and educator whose practice is rooted in printmaking and woodworking from which he creates architectural and landscape inspired works on paper and site specific installations. </p>



<p>His work draws from a fascination with the built and natural environments we inhabit and transform, taking inspiration from architecture, landscapes and the environment, and experimenting with process and materials.</p>



<p>Recent projects and residencies have seen Jamie exploring themes centred around climate and the environment, our relationship to land and the horizon, understanding our climatological past, and unknown futures that lie ahead.</p>



<p>The sharing of knowledge and skills is also important to Jamie and his creative practice. He regularly delivers workshops and courses across print studios, museums, galleries and art centres in the UK and internationally; recently including the British Council, Barbican Centre, Camden Art Centre, Bow Arts Trust and House 33 in Nigeria.</p>

<p>For this project I am researching historic climatological events that, due to centuries of exploitation of the landscape together with extreme weather events amidst a changing climate, led to the disappearance of a number of farms, homes and communities along the North East coast of Scotland.</p>



<p>Scattered along the Moray Firth and Aberdeenshire coastlines there is little to remind us of these disappeared settlements, communities and farms devastated by historic climatological events, remembered for the most part through fragmented legends, myths and ruins. Stories of drifting sand dunes, witches’ curses, environmental disaster and card games with the devil.</p>



<p>The focus of my research is on gaining an understanding of the human activity that contributed to these environmental catastrophes, with a view to developing new ideas and expanding concepts that will inform a body of climatologically engaged work.</p>



<p>I want to find out more about how people explained these events and changes in the climate and landscape over time and how a desire to find explanations and meaning often led to rumours pointing to accusations of curses by witches or the devil.</p>



<p>Having grown up around these places I am interested in how these have become the prevailing stories we remember locally; histories that are inextricably connected to the landscape as it has shifted and been reformed by natural forces and human hands.</p>



<p>During this project I am also continuing to explore and experiment with approaches to making prints, developing on from work made for previous residencies and exhibitions inspired by the environment, climate, materials and process.</p>



<p>I am making sketches and audio and visual recordings from these places, keeping a record of the project while engaging with local residents and historians to deliver workshops and discussions; all of which will inform my research and development of new artworks.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Nosheen Khwaja</strong></h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="803" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/N-KHWAJA-Headshot-1024x803.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8029"/></figure></div>



<p>Nosheen is an artist, designer, tech and filmmaker given enough time. She’s worked in many disciplines over the years but gravitates towards installations, large textile sculptures, film and sound. </p>



<p>The themes that run throughout her work are of the connections between power, control, seduction and the body. The brown female body within the cultural and physical landscape, of disruption and creating alternate lives that are connected and sensuous. </p>



<p>Nosheen is passionate about art and knowledge being available to all, and for it be accessible and interactive. She wants the divide between ‘art’ and viewer to dissolve and for the experience to be direct and tactile, fully involving the senses.</p>



<p>She co-founded the film training course Digital Desperados, is artistic director of&nbsp;GLITCH Film Festival and a member of POC2 – the programmers of colour collective. Over the last 20 years Nosheen has curated&nbsp;screenings, shown artwork and performed in Copenhagen, Hamburg, Berlin, Amsterdam, Montreal, New York and the UK.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She is currently also working on an experimental short on desire and the hidden places in the body.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>BROWN NOISE/WHITE NOISE</strong></h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="636" height="960" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/N-Khwaja_Mouthfull.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8030" srcset="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/N-Khwaja_Mouthfull.jpg 636w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/N-Khwaja_Mouthfull-199x300.jpg 199w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/N-Khwaja_Mouthfull-585x883.jpg 585w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/N-Khwaja_Mouthfull-100x151.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 636px) 100vw, 636px" /><figcaption>Mouthfull</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’ve worked in many mediums throughout my life and the thread running through them has focused on disruption, the landscape, control, flow, power and desire. </p>



<p>It’s always been my aim to create art which would physically affect the viewer.<br></p>



<p>I intend to make a short experimental film which will be projected in an echoic chamber, that I will construct. The inner walls will be made from raw sheep wool from the Highlands – a valuable natural resource that is often burned with petrol as it wouldn’t fetch enough money at market. I will also create a soundscape, including natural phenomena such as singing icebergs/ whistling winds &amp; storms/ water/migrating birds/and the bodies&#8217; own beats which the viewer will be able to hear in the chamber at quiet interludes. </p>



<p>I want people to interact fully with this piece. To touch it, smell it, have their perception altered by it. </p>



<p>This soundscape will alternate with periods of profound silence generated within an echoic chamber. </p>



<p>If someone stays long enough in these soundless spaces, then they can start to hallucinate.</p>



<p>Perhaps they will create their own internal film from everything their senses will absorb.<br></p>



<p>The key thing that I wish to communicate with this piece is that everything is connected; what is within and without….the state of inhabiting and loss. My observation is that sometimes people forget that the world we live in, the landscape, our bodies and our senses are all connected. </p>



<p>Our actions affect our environment and vice versa. It can be easy for people in relatively privileged positions to feel they aren’t affected by something that happens hundreds of miles away, or that they will be safe. That all they have to complain about is hot summers, wetter colder winters and the rising cost of imported food.</p>



<p>There will be abstract qualities to this piece, although the film installation will allow for more specificity. </p>



<p>I have two frustrations with dialogues around climate change that I wish to explore:<br>*the centralisation of white voices and concern for the wellbeing of western nation states<br> *that the blame is pinned on the consumer and not on capitalism.</p>



<p>Deconstruction, re-connection and communication are key to change.</p>

<p>Chris Manson is a writer and artist based in Glasgow. Originally from Hong Kong, Chris’ work draws heavily from his mixed Scottish-Chinese heritage.</p>



<p>His artistic output is primarily in genre fiction visual storytelling, and he has provided illustrations for investigative journalism pieces where the preservation of vulnerable peoples’ anonymity met the need to provide an insight into their personal stories and cultures.</p>



<p>Chris is an Electrical Engineering graduate of Strathclyde University and worked in the field of renewable energy from his university days up until 2014, including presentation of the benefits of renewable energy vs non-renewable at public events with the Museum of Science and Industry (MOSI) in Manchester, now known as the Science and Industry Museum (SIM).</p>



<p>Chris has experienced the climate impacts of unrestricted industrialisation first-hand. During the 2010s, industrial expansion around Shenzhou and the greater Guangzhou area caused a visible smog to form in Hong Kong, adversely impacting the health of vulnerable residents of the formerly relatively clean city.</p>



<p>Motivated by this experience and with the weight of his education behind him, Chris has found himself drawn towards projects that raise awareness of climate change – particularly those that encourage action on both the personal and corporate levels to minimise the impact human existence has on the world we share.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>RED THREADS OF FATE</strong> </h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="729" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sophie_100-1024x729.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8057" srcset="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sophie_100-1024x729.jpg 1024w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sophie_100-300x214.jpg 300w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sophie_100-768x547.jpg 768w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sophie_100-585x417.jpg 585w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sophie_100-1170x833.jpg 1170w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sophie_100-100x71.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Sophie</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Red Thread of Fate (variously translated as The Red String of Fate or the Red Thread of Marriage) is an old Chinese legend that has propagated across many East Asian cultures.</p>



<p>The legend says that two people, destined by the Gods to become partners, are connected by an invisible string that may stretch or become entangled along the way, but will never break – ultimately leading them together.</p>



<p>The proposed art piece, named “Red Threads of Fate”, plays with this idea – that no matter how various interests may manipulate or even conceal information from the public, it is undeniable that we can link human actions to climate events.</p>



<p>The piece will take the form of a walk-through installation, where stories are told by cards strung along the titular red paper ‘threads’, connecting large-scale events to stories of communities impacted by these events via scientific data points.</p>



<p>There will also be corresponding “Blue Threads”. Due to the artist’s belief that positivity and hope is also required to make change happen, these Blue Threads will connect actions and effects that have had a healing or otherwise positive effect on the environment.</p>



<p>The threads will be accompanied by a companion backdrop, where representations of the continents hang above the exhibit, with areas of land vulnerable to rising sea levels hanging down further still – the intended effect being that the disappearing land will be closer to eye level, and harder for attendees to ignore.</p>



<p>It is hoped that with the warnings of the Red Threads and the successes of the Blue Threads, this exhibit will spark critical thought on the causes of climate change, and provide a feeling of encouragement – specifically, that even though there are many issues at hand, we are more than capable of successfully doing something about them.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>FADZAI MWAKUTUYA</strong></h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSCF1425-2-e1571681611532.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-7967"/></figure></div>



<p>I am an innovative woman and artist from Zimbabwe who has a broad career in arts in the UK and Zimbabwe. Embracing a creative outlook on life I have adopted Scotland as my home and creative thinking space.</p>



<p>The process of creating my personal artwork explores unconventional mark making techniques such as charring, using textile resist methods and sculptures. Building my artwork layer upon layer is a cathartic process and allows me to transcend and remove myself from the challenges of daily life. I reuse found objects and natural materials to find new meanings within the layers of colour and texture. Zimbabwean traditional Sadza paste in my artwork reminds me of this food that I grew up eating everyday. It both comforts and grounds me attaching me to my motherland like an umbilical cord.</p>



<p>I use my artwork to advocate for mental well being within the marginalised communities in Scotland. My artistic ‘voice’ campaigns for ‘stolen identities’ and aims to reclaim my own identity as an artist in a society presenting many barriers to integration and professional development. Thinking or ‘creating outside the box’ allows me to challenge the migration conventions and break away from embedded stereo cast roles enhanced by culture shock and migration strongholds.</p>



<p>I was drawn to taking part in Enough!’s artist residency, Repository of the Undercommons as the project resonates with my values and interests. Creating visuals as a strategy to cope and advocate, is close to my heart. Where accountability is in question and needs to be collectively discussed, art activism, for me, is an impactful way to voice, challenge and campaign against injustice or for justice! Whilst collaborating with artists from abroad, I have forged links within some global arts communities. Locally, I have been exhibiting in the UK for the past 14 years and I have established contacts with the creative community in England and Scotland.</p>



<p>I would like to expand an online audience globally to support the climate change declaration. Thereafter I would like to partner with projects, museums and galleries to curate a travelling exhibition showcasing a universal body of work using an activist theme or combination of themes, e.g.: Protest Banner Images using digital technology and handmade artwork.</p>



<p>This research residency will record modern life as we see it, to inform the future, contributing and providing an educational insight into the policies and procedures that govern world politics and will be archived in varied formats for arts heritage.</p>



<p>In the future I aim to assist and encourage young Zimbabwean and Scottish Artists to collaborate in joint cultural exchange by informing, signposting and curating residencies.</p>



<p></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CLIMATE CHANGE CREATIVE COLLECTIVE (CCCC)</strong> </h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSCF3142-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-7968" srcset="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSCF3142-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSCF3142-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSCF3142-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSCF3142-585x390.jpg 585w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSCF3142-1170x780.jpg 1170w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSCF3142-100x67.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>CCCC’s agenda will be to visually highlight the climate change crisis. I intend to undertake research, develop and record ideas in response to the climate crisis, focusing on the use of the creative element. I will explore ways to create a simple online library of usable art and design for Artivism against climate change.</p>



<p>This social media platform will invite collaborations with other professionals, primarily young people, to create a visual gallery with images that everyone can access, engaging a global activist resource.</p>



<p>Creating, signposting promoting and managing an interactive creative protest online will require careful and well researched processes and considerations for a successful outcome.</p>



<p>I hope in this way to contribute to campaigns using impactful visuals for print as banners, posters, or online shared banners.</p>
