<p><br> “During the industrial era people were forced to endure long and bitter conflicts in their struggle to participate in the political system…It remains to be seen whether the transformation of traditional industrial societies will be accompanied by a regress of democratic structures or whether progress towards more democracy is already culturally anchored and irreversible.” <br> <br> <strong><em>Information panel, Ruhr Museum, 2019</em></strong><br> <br>Never one to miss out on a seminal moment, in 1790 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe travelled to Upper Silesia, then on the fringes of the Prussian Empire – where he witnessed the first ‘fire-machines’ – or steam engines, to operate on the continent. </p>



<p>Goethe
penned a few lines of advice to his hosts on what was then an isolated
frontier, asking them: “Far from educated people, at the end of the empire, who
helps you, find treasures and bring them to light?.”</p>



<p>The
polymath’s answer was succinct: “only understanding and honesty help; the two
keys that lead to any treasure that the earth holds.” </p>



<p>For Goethe, rational humanism, technological progress – and the ever-greater task of getting riches out from underneath the earth – could be conceived of as a single project. </p>



<p>But
despite two long centuries in which traditions of empiricism and scientific
inquiry seemed to move in step with industrial expansion and growth – this deep
narrative that undergirded capitalist development has, in our time, arrived at an
abrupt end. </p>



<p>Its
end can be seen in the brave new world of carbon-nationalism – humming
dissonant old tunes that drown out concepts of the planetary or the universal.
It can be heard in the words of an Australian Prime Minister who watches vast
swathes of his country burn, but encourages fireworks displays through the
smog, “to express to the world just how optimistic and positive we are.”</p>



<p>Coal has become, in recent years, bound up with belief in carbon-as-saviour. This represents an argument with scientific method – in so far as national truths become incompatible with basic ideas that have shaped modern industrial societies. Rejecting complexity, this belief centres on the nation as the only whole collective body we can recognise: a place that has heartlands, where honest nationals once did tough honest work. </p>



<p>In
2015, when US senator Jim Inhofe brought a snowball to Capitol Hill for a
debate on climate change, he wasn’t simply arguing with a demonstrable reality,
he was asserting a belief in the nation as a greater, religious, truth. Just as
there are no sacrificial rituals dedicated to science, there is no planet in
the minds of these men – just one tribe under god. </p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p>In
Europe’s coalfields, from Upper Silesia by the waters of the Vistula, to South
Wales on the shores of the Atlantic – mining is seen as a vital old tradition; not
quite, but soon to be lost to history. Solidarity and the raw truth of this
work – with its dirt and its danger – are regional bedrocks of tradition. </p>



<p>But
coal is more present than it has ever been — both in terms of the amount of
carbon that now sits in the atmosphere, and in our continued dependence on a
world in which cheap fuel and cheap labour are the basic players in the global
economy. But coal is also very old. Too old, in fact, for many of us to
comprehend. </p>



<p>This
point is not lost on the curators of the Silesian Museum, which opened in 2015.
Sited on a former colliery – the glass façades of its spectacular new
structures are decorated with images painted by former miner Ludwik Holesz, in
1968.</p>



<p>Holesz’s
painting was inspired by a fossilised leaf imprinted on a piece of coal from
the Carboniferous period and his painting depicts the flora and fauna, compressed
through millennia, into the riches and energy that made Upper Silesia. </p>

<p>There’s
a humility to this work too, with its inquisitive-eyed creatures darting with
vivid colours from behind ferns. All of that colour and imagination, leaping
from out of a primordial darkness, speaks to the kind of perspective and
vitality required to place the significance of carbon in context. </p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p>From Upper Silesia I travel some 600 miles west, to another heartland: the Ruhr valley. I see familiar uniforms, part of a mining culture that followed Prussian expansion and bedded down in both regions. One small legacy of that state’s military and bureaucratic might – underpinned by coal itself. <br></p>



<p>The fire machines which so impressed Goethe in the 1790s brought in their wake vast movements of people. They would soon transform the regions where their power was put to use beyond recognition. </p>



<p>Steam
meant movement, a new animating force for the age. The race to industrialise,
and get all that cheap energy out of the ground, brought Germans to what is now
Poland, Poles to the shores of the Rhine, and many other peoples still. However
much the ensuing centuries might have refashioned the flags, borders and
ideologies that ruled above ground – underneath it, coal held sway – a magnetic
force for the uprooted masses. By the 1890s, the population of the Ruhr stood
at around two million, compared to three hundred thousand in 1850.</p>



<p>If you transform the land, it sets the masses in motion. This is a basic fact but one worth noting. Here’s another to sit beside it: half of all the industrial carbon emissions in our atmosphere date from 1988. This is not something that has to be explained to the Chinese farmer’s son working at Foxconn, but the tragic coincidence of our times is that the observable planetary condition is as present at it is distant and unknowable. These truths invite a shrug: anyway, who can really know a whole world? We are all anchored to some small patch of it – and it is the genius of carbon nationalism to convince people, in their hearts, that <em>they</em> don’t have to move, even as the flames scorch the fringes of the homestead.</p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p>There are few monuments to the awesome power of coal and steel as spectacular as the Zollverein Industrial complex – with its iconic double winding gear. Closed in 1986, it was once the most productive mine in the world, today its vast, strange, beauty has won UNESCO World Heritage designation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="768" height="1024" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ruhrsteps-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8150" srcset="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ruhrsteps-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ruhrsteps-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ruhrsteps-585x780.jpg 585w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ruhrsteps-1170x1560.jpg 1170w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ruhrsteps-100x133.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<p>Now housing a range of cultural facilities within its cavernous surroundings, the air around these Bauhaus-inspired structures is clearer than it once was. This is frequently remarked upon by visitors from across Germany, many of whom still view the Ruhr as a smoke-black region of incessant noise and movement. </p>



<p>My guide, Frank Switala, whose grandfather came to the Ruhr at the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, explains how this perception was grounded in reality. <br><br> “I remember days in my childhood, where everything was polluted by smoke: my grandma tested the wind in the evening and then she decided if she could leave the washing out or take it in.”</p>



<p>Frank, a child of the post-war boom years, also recalls that this moment of intensive industrial expansion saw the Ruhr became something of a cosmopolitan heartland – a necessity given German industry&#8217;s thirst for labour.</p>



<p>“When I was kid after school, you could just throw your ball in the back and whistle and get ten or twelve kids around you and that team was as international as Liverpool FC is today.”</p>



<p>My
guide is also eager to tell me about his travels to Wales during the miner’s
strike: “my personal impression at that moment when I was there I thought, hey,
this country&#8217;s close to civil war.”</p>



<p>He
contrasts this with the German state’s willingness to subsidise local coal at
the time: “what we did was we bought social peace.” </p>



<p>Part of that legacy is Zollverein itself. Near the entrance to the Ruhr Museum, within the complex’s former coal washing plant, is a lump of coal from the last shift at the last hard coal mine in Germany, closed in 2018. Visitors are then invited downwards into the depths of the region’s pre-history – via a glowing orange stairway inspired by molten steel that befits a passage to the underworld. </p>



<p>“I find this is one of the best examples for the transition going on. And we try to keep up with the future, because there&#8217;s one day that will be coming when coal mining is a long, long time gone.”<br><br>  “We&#8217;re still in transition. This is something that has not completed. Yes. 150 years of industrialization. You cannot undo it in one or two generations,” explains Frank. </p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p>Travelling
across Germany, &nbsp;it’s striking to consider
that the country that worships Goethe’s mix of enlightenment humanism and
romantic obsession with prelapsarian nature, is facing political crises and a
wider sense of angst about its future. The engine room of Europe’s economy is
on a collision course with the contradictions of growth and development, and
the consequences of great wealth on a volatile planet. To crib a theme from the
great man’s canon – looking back, it all seems a bit Faustian. </p>



<p>Cheap
coal underpinned social democracy and the wonders of post-war economic recovery
in West Germany. It also lies just under the surface of contemporary divisions
— in the poorer East, the country’s green credentials are all too easily
presented as just another urban fad — and the opportunistic nationalism of AFD
is happy to portray climate change as a hoax. Similarly, as a recent scandal
concerning a satirical song about a carbon guzzling grandmother shows, the
demographic strains occurring across an ageing populace, are part of the
picture too. </p>



<p>The Scott Morrisons and Jim Inhofes of this world would like our memories to be short, and our imaginative sense of history as narrow as a national anthem. Increasingly, carbon-nationalism pits the traditional idealised image of the miner against the migrant – forgetting that, so often, they have been one and the same. </p>



<p>But far from being bound up with tradition, much of that carbon is fresh – in 1988 the world produced 8.75 billion tonnes of carbon from coal, compared to 14.57 billion tonnes in 2017. <br><br>All those tonnes of raw energy were some 300 million years in the making. The great anxiety of all those absurd old men, preaching national optimism and holding up coal as the authentic saviour, is a desperate desire to avoid confronting our mortal, finite, condition. Because even in the current orgy of burning, coal reminds us, above all, of our own irrelevance. Something that every miner, mixing his sweat and breath to unsettle awesome geological forces on a day to day basis, learns as an apprentice. </p>

<p><strong>&#8220;Across the continent, millions do not recognize themselves in the climate movement.&#8221;</strong><br><br><strong>Green New Deal for Europe, </strong><em><strong>Blue Print for Europe’s Just Transition </strong></em></p>



<p><strong>&#8220;The consumer is essentially somebody who feels, or is made to feel, lost, unless he or she is consuming. Brand names and logos become the place-names of the Nowhere.&#8221;</strong><br><br><strong>John Berger, </strong><em><strong>Ten Dispatches about Place </strong></em></p>



<p>I take the slow train from Berlin to the Polish border in the early morning. On the platform of an eastern suburban station, tired workers wearing puffer jackets and carrying sports bags smoke and chat in quick snatches of mother-tongue — cheerful at the flashes of recognition. We move through a deep mist settled over plains and forests, and then cross a river. On the other side, another train south, that began its journey at the Baltic sea, speeds along with its cargo segmented in the old fashioned six-person compartments. Everyone who enters is obligated to offer a greeting, and bids farewell to everyone else, having shared this warm space for a stretch. They don’t share much detail about what their journeys are for or where they terminate. </p>



<p>I see forests and small hamlets, some of which we stop at. The great smokestacks of coal-fired power, painted in the national colours of red and white, are one of the few notable reminders that a border has been crossed. The raw variety of capitalism that re-shaped Poland after everything changed 30 years ago, and which is now challenged in turn by a winning mix of nationalism, welfarism and social conservatism, dispensed with old-fashioned loyalties to place. Yet people have shifted to-and-fro here for centuries, and perhaps the outflow of workers to the glittering cluster cities westward from Berlin was inevitable. As inevitable as the ten-hour train home, punctuated by excited calls from relatives, the boredom in anticipation, the slumber needed but not to be achieved — the glittering corporate logos triumphant over Berlin Ostbahnhof, still imprinted on heavy eyelids.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>The rolling stock is probably not that much older than I am – like the post-Communist world, coming to terms with moving into its thirties. Yet, not for the first time, I’m reminded as we power along this fully-electrified line, of the peculiar British backwardness about such things. If this rolling stock originates in the Warsaw Pact era, it’s sobering to recall that much of Britain’s rail infrastructure is essentially still Victorian. </p>



<p>Our island is an island, stuck in its ways. Even if, as measured by the dead metric of growth, it outstrips many of these places, it reproduces itself on a loop. The modernity of Britain is absurd and excitable: simply the spectacle of property and wealth rising beyond the grasp of those who traipse above and underground. Modernity in Europe feels older, wrinkled and cranky, like an old barfly. It has lived through a lot more, if we’re honest. The full employment of Communism and its necessary equivalent in the relative comfort of the western social democracies are gone, but the sight of its worn form still lingering reminds those raised in Britain of the social solidarity that we never <em>really </em>had. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>A
few days later, in Katowice, I realise that the taste and smell of coal in a
large industrialised European city isn’t the only feature that makes the past
feel particularly present. </p>



<p>In this city —&nbsp; think of a coal cottonoplis — winding gear, some of which towers over pits still in use, can be seen across the horizon. 80% of Poland’s electricity still comes from coal, with much of it still hauled from below ground by the state-backed firm PGG. Around Katowice they dig hard coal: the good stuff. </p>



<p>At dawn the next morning I see miners in smart black uniforms and plumed caps wake up the residents of the model mining village Nikiszowiec with their brass band. They represent the opposite of the world of Poland post-EU accession, with its migration of millions of Poles abroad in search of work. Their music beats the bounds of the place they have made through their labours. It is the beginning of <em>Barbórka —</em> the feast day of St Barbara — the patron saint of all those who work in trades likely to be suddenly lethal – but here particularly venerated by miners. </p>



<p>The
getting of coal in Poland has long been fundamental to the national story.</p>



<p>There are no illusions here that this bedrock of history can simply be shrugged off. Although hundreds of thousands have left the industry in recent years, mining is still a major employer. But perhaps the way coal has knitted itself into the cultural fabric of Upper Silesia will be more significant in the longer term. Although for many years a debatable territory where the former domains of the great imperial houses of Europe converged — this is also a Polish heartland and coal is fundamental to what that modern nation became. </p>



<p>The miners were embraced by Communist leaders as a model for Soviet-inspired productivism. Edward Gierek, first secretary of the ruling Polish United Workers&#8217; Party throughout the 1970s, told them: “We will always be honoured to award miners for their effort and contribution to the development of our socialist homeland.”</p>



<p>But
despite their relatively privileged place in the system, miners also played a
seminal role in resistance to the authorities Gierek oversaw. Later, I visit
the weighty monument to nine miners killed at the Wujek colliery in 1981, during
a protracted period of strikes and occupations sparked by the regime’s
imposition of martial law, as living standards plummeted.</p>



<p>The bloody confrontation at Wujek was a pivotal moment in Poland’s transition from Communism, showing the significance of Solidarność&#8217;s actions a year after the Gdańsk Agreement. This use of state violence underlined the moral cause of the trade union&#8217;s protracted fight for national liberation, which, despite many compromises, achieved the unprecedented by establishing an autonomous trade union within a totalitarian system. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Across decades of enormous change — as regimes of different ideological and national stripes came and went in Upper Silesia – the heroic figure of the miner has remained a constant. Within this context, the Polish state’s recent opt-out from the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EU Commission’s Green Deal</a> is unsurprising, as is the minimal interest from miners themselves in talking about transition. Since Katowice hosted COP24 last year, many journalists from Western Europe have traipsed here seeking authentic characters agreeable to a rapid shift away from coal. But there is no shortage of people keen to talk about the difficult lived reality of life in a major coal-producing region. Citizens of small towns like Imielin tell me that they are threatened by a very literal undermining: as PGG seeks to expand mining operations a few hundred metres below their homes. The region also has some of the worst air quality on the continent. </p>



<p>This situation speaks to the questions at the forefront of my journey. How could a carbon transition keep hold of the legacy of democratic and social struggles that placed miners, with their unique role in society, in the vanguard? Could a radical Green New Deal re-establish the old proud loyalty to place: that desire for rootedness and community that the global market has robbed from so many? </p>



<p>The disparities around energy use across different EU regions demonstrates, on a more comprehensible scale, the great unspeakable blasphemy that haunts all talk of transition globally — the notion that growth and prosperity might not be part of the bargain. The idea that places where the missionaries of consumerism are still penetrating should not enjoy its promise, because they heard the gospel too late, makes a mockery of what many consider just. It’s easier to casually come to the view that everyone on the planet should forego a new washing machine, if your grandparents weren’t beaten and imprisoned for daring to object to the fact that no amount of toil would procure basic commodities. </p>



<p>There are three scraps of solace that we can take from this situation. Firstly, as has been shown by the way that people in the global south respond to catastrophic climate events, those with less often retain more resilient community networks — in contrast, high death tolls from heatwaves in Western Europe have been partly attributed to the fact that many elderly people live alone. Secondly, the unconventional history of Solidarność shows that class struggle does not have to follow a pre-ordained path. If working-class collective action can help topple one contradictory ideology, it can do so again. Finally, the way in which the region embraces the cultural significance of coal has a rich symbolic of power. Unlike the UK, they don’t simply want to forget all the dirt and blood bound up in the creation of energy systems &#8211; the focus of the next instalment documenting my journey. </p>

<p><em>This is the first in a series of articles reflecting on the last three weeks traveling for the Enough Routes programme. <a href="https://www.enough.scot/2019/10/10/acting-out/">Gehan Macleod</a> describes time spent helping out at two expressions of migrant solidarity at Calais and Ventimiglia.</em></p>



<p><strong>Ventimiglia</strong></p>



<p>Language can be limited in situations when
people speak Arabic in many dialects; Kurdish; French; borrowed Italian,
English learned through nursery rhymes related by an earnest school teacher in
some time that is now far away. A time that must feel further away as geography
and events displace <em>now</em> from <em>then</em>, displaced you from the lands
of your home. And yet the language of emotion across a face is universal; eyes
lit by mobiles and fierce joy while on calls to loved ones &#8211; familiar faces and
tones conjured up on small screens, enough light to scatter the darkness
momentarily. Moments that chase away the shadows of despair, or past and recent
traumas that stir emotions – emotions that cannot be allowed to smother hope. </p>

<p>It is a hope that compelled those I meet at the
roadside close to the border between Italy and France, to set off and leave all
that was familiar behind with loved ones, if war or unrest hadn’t taken them. </p>



<p>Hope that new places might obliterate loss. </p>



<p>Hope that new lands might offer asylum from torment
and repression. </p>



<p>Hope that has kept them moving on. </p>



<p>Through darkness. </p>



<p>Through danger. </p>



<p>Through miles and miles of strange land, strange
towns and strange glances. </p>



<p>Through borders when chance allowed. Hope that somewhere they might find the ‘better life’ sold to them and tens of thousands of others leaning in to flickering images of the West, transmitted into homes everywhere – neoliberal ideals of success brought to life by cathode ray tubes or perhaps liquid crystal. An empty promise they have come to call <em>the big lie</em>; <em>“</em>we now know Europe is a big lie” they say. Yet they cannot afford to let these thoughts cross their brow for more than a moment. Hope is all they have left – a marker that all they’ve endured has been for some end. </p>



<p>The talk soon returns to what opportunities might lie just beyond <em>that</em> horizon and plans for how to cross it. Their chat is interspersed with stories from their journeys to get to where they’re standing now. Humorous recounting of Bond-style attempts to cross borders; along live train tracks, furtive attempts to escape capture – something to pit your wits against, to display the kind of ingenuity and perseverance rewarded in other circles. Other times experiences of hardship related with a shudder, or encounters with ruthless smugglers.</p>

<p>Language can be limited and what can I convey
that a thousand articles in a hundred publications haven’t conveyed already? The
so-called migrant crisis must have been covered by tens of thousands of words
in print and broadcasts. We know that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_migrant_crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 2015 the situation</a> has worsened. Yet <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/24/it-could-have-been-me-refugees-describe-their-journeys-to-the-uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">individual stories</a> are made and remade
every day. Small snatches of the stories of the 31 men and eight women found
dead in a container in Essex have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/24/essex-lorry-deaths-39-victims-were-chinese-nationals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made the headlines</a>. But there are many
more stories unfolding as I write this (as you read it). What can I truthfully
say to Mohammed and Mûrtha searching my face for hope, for some kind of answer?
Do I agree that there will be a good-paying job waiting for them in a UK free
from racism? Or do I risk undermining that precious hope they have? I want to
offer answers, affirm their sense of hope. I want to see some way to have hope
myself &#8211; that this situation could be overturned, if not for these guys, for
those who will otherwise come after them. But it all feels so overwhelmingly
wrong and fucked up. With no answers and no other way to feel I can do
something, I sink my arms into cauldron-like cooking pots and scrub. I sort
wood sheds. I peel carrots. I chop onions at the makeshift kitchen in the
mountains of <a href="https://keshaniya.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kesha Niya</a> – Surani Kurdish for ‘No Problem’. Here, off
their own backs, they’ve been cooking a hot meal every day for around 100
displaced people for the past few years. They are supported by <a href="https://www.roya-citoyenne.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roya Citoyenne</a>, an association that promotes “intercommunality” in nearby Roya. They
transport and serve the food about 40 minutes drive away in an unused car park in
<a href="https://www.redpepper.org.uk/the-deadly-border-politics-of-ventimiglia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ventimiglia</a>, on the Italian
Riviera. They’ve seen times when the numbers have swelled to 600 or more. The
night we are there it’s dark and around eighty guys line up next to a flyover for
a hot meal dished up by the small crew of volunteers. Others will have found
refuge in the Red Cross camp nearby, a place many will not go as entry requires
being fingerprinted; a process that can prevent applications for asylum
elsewhere in Europe.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="768" height="1024" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kesha-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8083" srcset="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kesha-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kesha-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kesha-585x780.jpg 585w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kesha-100x133.jpg 100w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kesha.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<p>About 5 miles away, by the side of the road, the
same small group offer an all-day resting place to those pushed back from the
French-Italian border, just a few hundred feet further down the road. They
offer fresh food, hot coffee and water, somewhere to charge mobiles and advice
to the 80 to 100 or more people a day who were stopped trying to walk past
police at the border. The unlucky are those detained in containers overnight and
not released until 4 p.m. the following day – without food or water. These guys
drink long from the plastic water cans balanced on a low roadside wall. Kesha
Niya have self-organised this resting place for around two years – every day
since last May. They record and compile data: where people have travelled from,
which routes they’ve taken, women or minors travelling alone, as well as
incidents of illegal or ill treatment at the border<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>.
They have seen an increase in French police turning away young adults (still
legally children), who they are supposed to guarantee protection to. They do so
by falsifying their date of birth on the papers they issue to them; dates that
are obviously false, such as 01/01/2000. They are particularly concerned about
the use of the containers. The facilities at the border do not allow for
detention &#8211; the French police are only legally supposed to detain people for
the purposes of confirming their identity. Given the recent find in Essex, this
is a particularly chilling development. The day I left, there were reportedly
30-50 guys who were detained between 3 containers arranged to form a courtyard.
Pepper spray was used and when this triggered an epileptic fit, there were only
half-hearted attempts to offer medical support, while other officers looked on
and laughed. Another man showed police his medical papers to demonstrate his
need for diabetic medication and was met with a similar response. A Moroccan
migrant captured some of this on his phone. The organisers are not hopeful
about exerting pressure that would persuade the French police to ensure they operate
within the law.</p>



<p><strong>Calais</strong></p>



<p>Many of the guys passing Ventimiglia are heading
for Calais. When I left there earlier in the week, French police were in the
process of evicting some of the sites surrounding the port, where we were told there
are currently around 700 displaced people encamped. There have been <a href="https://helprefugees.org/news/the-calais-jungle-three-years-on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 1,300 recorded evictions</a> since the
world-renowned <em>Jungle</em> was evicted in 2016 – on 24 October, exactly three
years ago the day I arrive there. There are a number of organisations there in
solidarity with existing refugees and the new migrants arriving daily. Not just
well-established NGOs but spontaneous groups like <a href="https://helprefugees.org/latest-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Help Refugees</a> and <a href="http://www.refugeecommunitykitchen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Refugee Community Kitchen</a>; citizen-led responses to the very real situation
displaced people find themselves in &#8211; a direct expression of solidarity and
mutual aid. These groups are filling gaping chasms left by European governments
whose immigration policies are woefully inadequate in response to the
challenges posed by migration. It’s not hard to see the ‘migrant crisis’, a
term worthy of critical reflection, was at least worsened, if not created by
their own foreign policies and other international interventions variously
motivated or by the climate change that has been one of the deadly costs of
Europe’s wealth.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="768" height="1024" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/thumbnail-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8084" srcset="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/thumbnail.jpg 768w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/thumbnail-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/thumbnail-585x780.jpg 585w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/thumbnail-100x133.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<p>Since 2015, RCK have been cooking and distributing 1200-1500 hot meals a day to displaced people camped around Calais and Dunkirk. It’s an effort impressive in scale and delivered with expertise and care on minimal resources. An effort made only more impressive by the self-organisation the place runs on; decisions are made collectively through daily meetings. It was there, while washing more pots and preparing veg &#8211; that I found out about the group in Ventimiglia. RCK cook from 9 a.m., distributions start mid-afternoon and they work until past 7 p.m. and like Kesha Niya, these efforts are entirely driven by volunteers, many of whom are informed, compassionate young people looking for an immediate means to make some difference in a world they’ve inherited. One young woman travels down from studying for a degree in International Relations at Edinburgh Uni to help out here. She says she can’t wait until she has graduated so she can be here longer, although she’s still trying to figure out how to support herself to do so. She says she loves meeting the people out on distribution; getting to know familiar faces but she also mentions how the self-organising works for her. It seems the streamlined operation is the result of many people’s expertise and creativity &#8211; problem solving together to make things flow more smoothly. </p>



<p>She feels her contributions are not only welcome but useful. They were also able to absorb significant numbers of new volunteers and very quickly have them on a useful task. Here people are working long hours for no pay and the atmosphere borders on festival-like at times; loud tunes pump out and a disco light pulsates over the huge pots of curry cooking. It’s also clear that a ton of relevant expertise has landed and informed the running of the place in ways that just make sense – I’m there during the weekly deep clean that would put a professional kitchen to shame. I mention this as there’s something that strikes me that relates to John Holloway’s ‘doing’ as distinct from alienated labour<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> and Illich’s autonomous action that are important in <em>acting out</em>, of finding ways to degrow and regrow, of adapting to crisis. </p>



<p><strong>Language of limits</strong></p>



<p>When I was packing, I grabbed a couple of thin books to keep baggage down. One was Illich’s <em>Right to Useful Unemployment</em>. Somehow whenever I open Illich I find something that hits the nail squarely on the head. Crisis, he says, has become an indicator that experts must step in while normal liberties are suspended &#8211; a perversion from Greek roots that suggested ‘choices’ or ‘turning points’. He insists it could mean “the marvellous moment when people suddenly become aware of their self-imposed cages and the possibility of a different life.” Michael Dunn’s description of the migrant crisis as <a href="https://edgeryders.eu/t/mobile-independent-clinic/827" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a training ground</a> for other forms of crisis, was the first time I’d come across this perspective. At both Calais and Ventimiglia this was evident. In the face of unimaginable precarity and risk, it was impossible not be to impressed and deeply moved by the quiet dignity of the guys I met, whose grasp on hope and a heavy sense of humour kept them going. Those who’ve left all that is familiar in the hope of safety from oppression, war or unrest or simply a better way of life – have something massive to teach about starting out on the arduous but critical degrowth journeys I believe we must all begin. </p>



<p>We need to leave much that we’ve built behind; status, professional reputations and the stuff we’ve accumulated and venture into unfamiliar territories contoured by new assumptions on which we can found more generative cultures and more compassionate ways of being. There are personal journeys to be made that require us to get damn good at crossing borders. Traversing ideological borders; conversing beyond the increasingly polarised spaces that now make up our society. Perhaps more than anything though, <em>crossing the borders we create with our minds</em>; the inner language of limits that reflects outer limits we impose as we inhabit spaces prescribed by borders reinforced and policed by our social conditioning<em>, </em>the endless ways we comply with narratives or societal practices that are not serving us, humanity or the planet.Prescribed lives lived within limits so as to comply with economic growth and free markets that know no limits. How often when we discuss imposing limits on growth, do we conflate that with imposing limits on self – as if growth <em>is</em> us? Sure personal choices and consumer behaviour are bound up in the issue. But it is not the same. It is not transactional. When we cease to live within limits in this sense, when we act outwith these borders we start to language new possibilities, new forms of dialoguing with others and the world, and find new ways to be in solidarity with one another. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="768" height="1024" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sleepbags-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8087" srcset="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sleepbags-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sleepbags-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sleepbags-585x780.jpg 585w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sleepbags-100x133.jpg 100w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sleepbags.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<p>A favourite quote of mine is from the Aboriginal
activist Lilla Watson who suggests; </p>



<p>“<em>if
you have come here to help me – you are wasting your time. If you have come
because your liberation is bound up with mine, then let us work together.</em>” </p>



<p>It describes perfectly the difference in power
relation bound up in charity as distinct from solidarity. I saw in these
citizen-led, self-initiated responses to the migrant crisis, training grounds where
people were working together in ways that recover our collective liberation.
Acts that go beyond transactional offers of charity. Training grounds for
acting outwith the status quo, beyond the mediated experiences of consumer
society, where transactional ways of relating form a radical monopoly on too
much of our lives; how we vote, how we meet our needs, how we offer compassion.
Here people are learning another way of responding – beyond campaigning, beyond
donations, beyond petitions and beyond governments or NGOs. A way of responding
that is immediate, founded in mutual aid and rooted in self-organising. Direct
responses to another individual’s situation – hard to imagine compassion more
radical than that. Powerful lessons in building the kind of bottom-up
counterpower I believe is called for in bringing about the order of change
essential both for degrowth or deep adaptation. These are the spaces where we
prefigure new ways of being, new manners of organising society, engage in the life-giving
business of Holloway’s <em>doing</em>. These are the experiences that once tasted
are never lost. That I tasted at spaces like Pollok Free State. That the
student from Edinburgh has tasted at the Refugee Community Kitchen.
Countercultural spaces we will continue to seek out because on some level we
know there is something more essential to our human beingness that we find there.
Countercultural spaces that can generate a wider culture that supports new
expressions of society and humanity in the face of the current crisis-cluster. </p>



<p>Migrant solidarity is evidently a clear area around which people are self-organising and ‘acting out’; the kind of citizen-led responses I set out to find. I wonder about the scale of this response &#8211; it would be interesting to map this kind of activity, if someone hasn’t done so already. Although it’s also true that those I’ve visited are small in comparison to the sheer numbers of displaced peoples passing through Europe. And then I’m reminded of another quote &#8211; by the German poet Rilke; <br><br>“<em>Again and again in history some people wake up. They have no ground in the crowd and move to broader deeper laws. They carry strange customs with them and demand room for bold and audacious action. The future speaks ruthlessly through them.</em>”<br> The language of the future knows no limits, other than those we create ourselves. <br></p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/coal-1626368_960_720.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8004" width="600" srcset="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/coal-1626368_960_720.jpg 960w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/coal-1626368_960_720-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/coal-1626368_960_720-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/coal-1626368_960_720-585x439.jpg 585w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/coal-1626368_960_720-100x75.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></figure></div>



<p>Setting out at a moment of profound disconnection and disruption – in mid-winter – my journey will trace a route through places often obscured and forgotten by the growth model consensus. In visiting sites that are, in the weary phrase ‘left-behind’ – I want to ask what models for cultural and community-based resilience remain when the vanguard of late-capitalism has long since disappeared from the horizon.</p>



<p>Focused
on a set of mining communities: the journey will be dark, literally
and figuratively. I want to propose that this ‘darkness,’ as in
much European folklore, is rich with the potential for discovery. 
</p>



<p>The
journey will take in coal communities situated in diverse geographic
and cultural contexts, poised at various different stages of
transition – from pits long-defunct, to those still powering the
factories of Central Europe. Along the way, I will connect with local
activists contending with the pervasive challenges of ecological
destruction and the rise of the far-right. 
</p>



<p>I
will travel with artefacts from the Scottish coalfield, sourced from
the archive, to provoke discussion about communities built around
extractive industries – where ‘de-growth’ of local economies
has long been a lived reality. Older, slower, forms of movement,
fundamental to Scotland’s once vast carbon export industry, play a
role here too. These links demonstrate that commerce and cultural
exchange predate the carbon era, and, even at the height of the coal
industry’s massive export boom, facilitated the emergence of
cultural and social ties. 
</p>



<p>A
key inspiration is Jan Moir and John Berger’s 1975 work of
narrative non-fiction, <em>A
Seventh Man,</em>
which observed the transient life of migrants across Europe —
revealing the notionally marginal figure of the migrant as absolutely
central to modern experience. Similarly, by looking closely at the
lives of several European carbon communities, often located in
geographically peripheral areas, this journey sets out to map a new
geography of power and change. By channelling voices from communities
that have generally been viewed as marginal to life in contemporary
Europe, I will ask what it means to be the last generation of workers
in an industry so central to the continent’s historic dominance.
The journey is premised on the certainty that we can only pursue a
worthwhile low-carbon future, by first exploring the links, cultures
and solidarities forged in the carbon era.</p>



<p>I
also want to consider what a Green New Deal will mean in radically
different contexts across the continent – with an eye on the
origins of the European project in the Coal and Steel Community – a
fundamentally resource based effort, but also a great moral venture. 
</p>



<p>
Where
might a new founding moment be located? Rather than the towering
glass centres of financial and political power, I want to look
underground – in the hills and forests so often dismissed as dirty,
dark and backward – the places where transformations have always
taken place. 
</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>by Nish Doshi</p>



<p>“Why is environmentalism so white?” With well over a decade in and out of the climate movement in the UK, this is a question I’ve often been asked, and it’s a question that makes me cringe a little. Climate change isn’t an environmental issue, in my opinion, it’s an issue of human rights. It’s borne out of a broken system &#8211; a system that has casually put profit and resource accumulation before people.  </p>



<p>I became aware of climate change at a
young age. I’d grown up in Kenya, and at 12, we were hit with a
<a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/kenya/kenya-country-update-22-sep-2000-kenyas-drought-no-sign-any-let" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major
drought</a>. The result was devastating for the majority
of the population. As a middle class kid growing up in Nairobi, I
didn’t experience the worst of it &#8211; only water shortages and
electricity rationing (due to Kenya’s dependence on
hydroelectricity at the time). But for the rest of the country &#8211; this
meant famine, poverty and mass displacement. The impact of climate
change was visible. It was right in front of us. 
</p>



<p>Instead of centering the lives of those most impacted &#8211; like the destitution of the Turkana peoples &#8211; Kenya’s response was to protect the middle classes from further disruption. They built coal power plants. Aid poured in from the global north, with programmes designed to transform pastoral systems. Tackling the root causes of climate change was not on the agenda.</p>



<p>As a child, I couldn’t understand why. Why weren’t we talking about an end to fossil fuels? But I’d already witnessed the 1998 bombings of the American Embassy in Kenya, and that experience had taught me that all lives which weren’t protected by the global north were expendable in the eyes of the American Empire.</p>



<p>In Kenya, environmentalism meant
National Parks. It meant protecting elephants from poachers hungry
for ivory. It meant mass tourist safaris. It didn’t mean the lives
of every day people. It didn’t mean the lives of groups like the
Ogiek who had been removed from their lands so these National Parks
could be built. And it certainly didn’t mean the lives of poor
rural communities whose lives had been devastated by drought and
flash flooding.</p>



<p>So when people ask me “why is
environmentalism so white?” when referring to the mass
demonstrations against climate change in the UK, I like to answer
that it is because they see climate change as an issue of
‘environmentalism’ rather than an issue of social justice. <br>
<br>
It
is with ‘Climate Justice’ in sight that I have planned my journey
as part of the Routes section of the Enough! project. 
</p>



<p>Through my travels, I hope to show you how our many social justice campaigns and struggles are interconnected with climate justice. From migrant rights to anti-gentrification and safe housing projects. My focus will be on People of Colour (racialised people) and their spaces of resistance and resilience, as we are so often left on the sidelines when it comes to any discussion of climate change in mainstream and activist spaces. I will also introduce you to groups who are actively trying to change that &#8211; centering race and global north/south divides in their work.</p>



<p>I am starting in Barcelona, where I
have already started conversations on issues ranging from migrant
rights, decolonisation, feminism, to housing rights and reclaiming
public spaces. From there, I move onto the Czech Republic to share
stories of Romani and Czech communities working together to fight
gentrification in an old coal mining town which still faces toxic
pollution from nearby chemical factories. After that I’ll be
meeting folks from Berlin who have been actively working on creating
spaces for people of colour in the climate movement. I’ll move onto
the Netherlands &amp; Brussels where we’ll hear from a number of
activists working on decolonising climate change and reclaiming
‘climate justice’ as part of their movements.</p>



<p>I cannot tell you exactly what I expect
to encounter in each of these spaces; I hope they will tell you
instead. The stories I share &#8211; here and on Instagram &#8211; will be ones

<p><br><em><strong>Nishma Doshi travelled around Europe with our </strong></em><a href="https://www.enough.scot/routes-response/"><em><strong>Routes programme</strong></em></a><em><strong>. Here they describe how fighting for housing rights is a part of climate justice in Barcelona.</strong></em></p>



<p><br>What is climate justice? What are we fighting for when we talk about stopping climate change?</p>



<p>Climate breakdown is a problem because it threatens our lives. It threatens our lives because it makes the world around us inhospitable, to us and to other species. It means losing our homes, access to clean water, access to good nutritious food, access to all our basic needs.</p>



<p>So when we are fighting for survival &#8211; which is what stopping climate change is about &#8211; we are fighting for our basic needs. We are fighting for healthy lives; we are fighting for the continued access to our basic needs. That&#8217;s ultimately what climate justice is about. It&#8217;s about an globally equal and equitable access to that which gives us life.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why one of my stops in Barcelona was at the <a href="http://labase.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">La Base: Ateneu Co-operatiu</a>, where the <a href="http://sindicatdebarri.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sindicat de barri del Poble Sec</a> (the neighbourhood union for the Poble Sec area) were having their weekly assembly. </p>



<p>Across Barcelona, different neighbourhoods (barris) have collectively organised to stop evictions and protect basic housing rights. Poble Sec is of particular interest as it is relatively small neighbourhood with a diverse population; residents come from across Europe, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador and Pakistan &#8211; as well as local Catalans.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The weekly meetings</h3>



<p>The sindicat meets once a week on Monday night. There, they discuss general strategies for upcoming political issues as well as provide support for community cases. Folks with cases &#8211; largely related to housing &#8211; drop their names in a jar at the beginning of the meeting, and after the strategy session ends, those names are pulled out, they get a chance to state their case, and assembly members collectively suggest support and solutions. </p>



<p>To be more inclusive, the meetings are held in Spanish (Castellano) as many of the migrants from Latin America do not speak Catalan. This is quite an important compromise made as many Catalans refuse to speak Castellano as a voice of dissent against the Spanish government which has repeatedly, and violently, repressed Catalonia&#8217;s demand for independence &#8211; as we are witnessing right now.</p>



<p>As I don&#8217;t speak Castellano or Catalan, I was kindly invited to the assembly by one of the sindicat&#8217;s members &#8211; Lorenzo. While the original aim of the sindicat was to deal with many political issues, he tells me, most of the actual organising work ends up being around housing as that is what is most urgent. Evictions are common due to rent rises, and increased property speculation. Most cases that come to the sindicat are related to evictions.</p>



<p>With Barcelona increasingly building its economy around tourism, property speculation in popular areas &#8211; like the city centre &#8211; is rampant. Airbnb** has also become a problem, with an increasing amount of flats and spare bedrooms used for temporary tourists rather than for local community housing. </p>



<p>There are also issues around rights to rent for those without the right papers &#8211; that can mean rights of residency to landlords requiring long-term job contracts. Many migrants feel caught in a trap: without rights of residency it is hard to find a job; and without a job it is impossible to rent a space in order to acquire rights of residency. This can be a problem for EU migrants too.</p>



<p>The meetings are organised in a circle (as far as possible) &#8211; with members volunteering for different roles each week. These roles can be &#8220;Masters of Ceremony&#8221; to childcare to welcoming new members. Fragments of the meeting which were translated to me were decisions on how to show solidarity with another barri eviction to how to respond to the sentences placed on Catalan leaders pushing for independence. It is observable how most of the strategy section engages more of the ethnic Catalan activists, while the racialised people* remain mostly quiet. <br><br>The case work is particularly interesting &#8211; and this is really where the issues of the immigrant population are raised. Once a name is called from the jar, that person either states their problem or gives an update on their case. Members of the community then give their advice and expertise. If needs be, the community will come together and stop an eviction or campaign together to challenge a landlord or the municipal government.</p>



<p>It is also important to note that, of the racialised people in attendence, almost all were women. I was told that women are often left with the responsibility of seeking help/support, especially in issues of housing and the family. This work is deeply gendered, with the majority of the responsibility falling on women.</p>



<p>Furthermore there is a visible divide between the racialised peoples in the space and the white activists &#8211; the latter seem to hold most of the organisational responsibility. One of them &#8211; Dan &#8211; also pointed out this distinction, calling it a unintentional &#8220;hierarchy&#8221;.</p>



<p>Obviously some work needs to be done to bridge these divides still. As I travelled and spoke to more people in Barcelona, this was an issue that was brought up over and over again. And it&#8217;s also been an issue I&#8217;ve observed in Scotland too. </p>



<p>In my experience, this often comes to how a space is run &#8211; the norms of the organisation can be &#8216;foreign&#8217; to those who have no direct experience of this kind of organising before.  And example of these norms could be consensus decision making or rotating roles. These norms are often uncritically accepted into organisational structures with no real space for reform or explorations of alternatives.</p>



<p>This makes it difficult for those of us who don&#8217;t fully embrace or feel part of anarchist organising to feel distanced or ostracised from the project. We are always working in ways which are culturally suited for our white colleagues and not really for us or the communities we come from. A longer discussion on community organising methods which centres the experiences of marginalised and racialised people seems really necessary if we want to overcome these divides.<br></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">La Base: Ateneu Co-operatiu</h3>



<p>La Base was formed after the Indignados movement, when people felt it was necessary to have infrastructure and access to amenities in order to organise for change.</p>



<p>The space has meeting rooms, a daily kitchen co-operative which serves up an affordable lunch, a workspace for basic building and repairs, a feminist collective, and a number of other projects apart from the sindicat. The projects provide local employment and benefits local companies and businesses.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Housing Justice is Climate Justice</h3>



<p>Hurricane Katrina destroyed the lives of so many people, houses were flooded and washed away. But the oak trees remained. They stood tall and weathered the storm because their roots were intertwinned. Of the over 700 oak trees in New Orleans, only 40 died. The rest held on.<br><br>As we saw with Katrina, responses to the catastrophic effects of climate change are deeply racialised. Black working class communities are still not getting the support they need.</p>



<p>As Clara-Luisa Weichelt and Julieta Perucca explain:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>&#8220;Governments worldwide fail to provide safe housing and basic infrastructure for a massive amount of people – and the challenges are increasing. People are frequently driven to live in informal settlements by environmental factors, such as natural disasters or environmental degradation that tend to happen more frequently due to climate change. But, the settlements to which they migrate also place them at risk: Nonresistant houses on land that is at risk of flooding, storm surges, mudslides, earthquakes, or contaminated sites, close to roads, waste and/or factories, is more likely to be vacant and is less likely to be contested for investment or development. The lack of basic infrastructure as access to drinking water, health provision, sewage systems, electricity and education as well as the lack of political and social recognition further exacerbates their vulnerability.&#8221;</p><cite><a href="https://www.habitants.org/news/global_info/the_nexus_between_the_right_to_housing_and_climate_change_insights_from_the_climate_conference_cop24_in_katowice_poland" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Nexus between the Right to Housing and Climate Change</a> – Insights from the Climate Conference COP24 in Katowice, Poland, (Thursday 10 January 2019)</cite></blockquote>



<p>Adequate housing rights for all, especially the marginalised in essential in preventing the worst impacts of climate change. Given the failure of governments to meet these basic needs, it has become essential that communities organise together to defend their rights.</p>



<p>If we want to survive what climate change is throwing at us now, as well as in the future, we need to find ways to supporting each other. The sindicat de barri del Poble Sec is one way which people are building connections and working together to deal with housing insecurity. While it&#8217;s not perfect, it&#8217;s providing many people with the support that they need; support that prevents them from ending up homeless and on the street.</p>



<p></p>



<p>*In Spain, People of Colour (PoC) or Black, Indigenous and People of Colour (BIPOC) are not used. The word commonly used translates as &#8220;racialised people&#8221;. This is because the process of Spain&#8217;s colonisation was dissimilar to that of British colonialism, and thus racial categories are different. <br>** While Spain has passed a law requiring all Airbnbs to pay taxes, EU data protection laws allow Airbnb to not disclose who is renting a room through the service. This means that the government struggles to enforce the tax. (This has been further impacted by a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/airbnb-wins-legal-victory-as-top-eu-court-defines-firm-as-information-society-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent EU court ruling</a> that has declared Airbnb not a real estate company)</p>

<p><em><strong>Gehan Macleod is one of the people traveling around Europe with our </strong></em><a href="https://www.enough.scot/routes-response/"><em><strong>Routes programme</strong></em></a><em><strong>. Here she describes where she&#8217;s coming from and where&#8217;s shes headed to.</strong></em></p>



<p>Coming from a 90s background in environmental and anti-nuclear activism, I found myself involved in the beginnings of GalGael &#8211; a community organisation that originated around a protest fire at Pollok Free State, an anti motorway camp. Since then I’ve notched up over twenty years experience of wrestling with the challenges in one place, GalGael; in one community; Govan in Glasgow. In many ways that&#8217;s been incredibly varied and I’ve absorbed learning from many lessons, some more painful than others. In a world where relationships can be superficial and transient, it&#8217;s the wrestle of making community of place that has taught me the most. Having grown tired of being anti-stuff, GalGael has been a place where I can explore being for-stuff.</p>



<p>I’ve also kind of had it with rearranging-deck-chairs-on-the-Titanic kind of change, petitions and a lot of the well intentioned change work that goes on &#8211; including increasingly detailed analysis of all that’s going so categorically wrong. I have a hunch this distracts us from our current societal narratives, beliefs, practices and structures &#8211; the assumptive layer that endlessly perpetuates our demise. Illich’s words ring in my ears &#8211; “<em>the present world is built on assumptions we haven’t yet found names for”. </em> This provides a starting point for my Routes journey. In response to the western world we’ve created &#8211; I want to act out. And I want to connect with others who are acting out; acting outwith the current assumptions that constrain our existence, that put a day in day out kind of strain on our souls and debase our humanity; acting outwith the market &#8211; not only surviving but reconceptualising what thriving looks like.</p>



<p>So my journey will seek to connect up with others who are acting out by prototyping new ways of organising society &#8211; away from commodification, around health and compassion, organising support systems within and outwith the state or the institutions already submerged in <a href="http://writingcities.com/2015/11/20/ivan-illichs-tr-conviviality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Illich’s second watershed</a> (two Illich references I know &#8211; expect more!). My Routes journey will seek out those self organising new forms of social security based on mutual aid, practical forms of solidarity in the face of the collapsing systems straddled by our teetering current economic system. Where are others using prefigurative ways of organising that dismantle old norms and prototype new narratives &#8211; where are people already perpetuating the culture shift needed? This journey will take me in to exploring counter cultural spaces and experiences that contribute to greater autonomy or unlearning old patterns as well as exploring practices such as commoning, citizen organising and culture hacking. Traveling by ferry and rail I’ll be looking out for and recording instances where collapsing systems can be seen to interface with the emergence of new possibilities. </p>



<p>I plan to write about the practicalities of traveling without planes. Mostly though I want to share through blog posts and social media thoughts about what we can learn from these experiences and what this says about how to network responses and join up opportunities arising from collapse. Working with the principles of complexity, I want to be open to what I might find and where I might find it. So my plans are loose and still forming. For now though I imagine that they might take me: to France to explore Autonomous Zones such as <em>Le ZAD Zone à Defender Notre-Dame-des-Landes</em> or the refugee camps on the coast; to Ghent to check out the multiplicity of commons related projects; to Utrecth to souch out what’s happening with citizens basic income trial and find out more about their freelance unions. </p>



<p>I look forward to being in conversation with others &#8211; on my journey and back home in Scotland, online and face to face &#8211; staying constantly curious about what precisely it is that these times call for.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Enough! Collective is supporting an individual to undertake a month’s travel through Europe this Autumn. </h3>



<p>Enough! Is supporting three routes journeys during 2019. We work  collaboratively with individuals and support them to create their route-map and equip them with the skills and tools required to get the most  out of the project.</p>



<p>Through these journeys, Enough! will create a low-carbon route map  around Europe. <br><br>We are seeking to change the pace and give people a new  experience – a new modality to help refresh / awaken / enliven  ourselves. The idea is to connect people throughout Europe working on  responses to new climate realities, degrowth and deep adaptation. </p>



<p>Individuals will be offered a travel and living grant.</p>



<p>The
purpose is twofold:</p>



<p>1. To support people working in community in Scotland by offering them the chance to travel and engage with ideas across the continent. By being asked to articulate their own project, community or work they may gain insight from afar. In doing this we are creating a loop back to Scotland bringing new ideas and people and contacts.</p>



<p>2.
To help build and connect the environmental justice movement responding to
climate crisis.</p>



<p>Travel will be by sail and train &#8211; and people will be asked to document and share their travels via audio recordings, written blog entries, photography, film or whatever is appropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>Enough will work collaboratively with individuals and support them to create their route map and equip them with the skills and tools required to get the most out of the project. Enough will then also curate the route map and fill it with editorial content.</p>



<p>Each month long journey is supported by a grant of &#8211; £2,500 to cover travel and expenses.</p>



<p>The budget is to be used at the participants discretion. The travel grant is intended to offset living expenses to allow participation.</p>



<p>The only stipulations are that:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>the participant may not use air travel</li><li>the participant is asked to record and document their experience to contribute to the online map</li><li>the participant understands and is in agreement with Enoughs aims and ethos</li></ul>



<p><br></p>



<p><strong>Deadline for submissions: Monday 12 August 2019</strong></p>



<p>Applicants will be notified by Wednesday Monday 26 August 2019.</p>



<p>To apply please email us at info@enough.scot supplying the following:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>A short covering statement explaining why this opportunity will benefit your work/community (500 words max)  </li><li>Your CV including full contact details  </li><li>Some ideas of where you might travel and why</li></ul>
