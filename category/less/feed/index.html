<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I hear the storm. They talk to me about progress, about ‘achievements’; diseases cured, improved standards of living. I am talking about societies drained of their essence, cultures trampled underfoot, institutions undermined, lands confiscated, religions smashed, magnificent artistic creations destroyed, extraordinary possibilities wiped out.” – Aimé Césaire, <em>Discourse on Colonialism</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ever since hearing it a few years ago, I’ve been haunted by what I take to be a very important statistic. Whilst making up just 5% of the world’s population, Indigenous peoples protect and steward 80% of global biodiversity. Indigenous peoples have generally managed to co-exist in relative balance with the environments they inhabit, and which they, more often than not, see themselves as a part of. For those of us who are not among this 5%, this statistic forces us to ask if there’s a need to learn, or indeed relearn, how to live with the rest of the more-than-human world in ways that resemble how Indigenous peoples do.</p>



<p>The question that has been preoccupying me over the past couple years is what could this mean here, in Scotland, or more specifically in the Highlands and Islands – the Gàidhealtachd? I’ll situate this consideration in and amongst the hotly debated, current, and divisive issue of rewilding and how it could relate to both repeopling and cultural revival.</p>



<p>But to start, I’ll begin with a plant: <em>Avena Strigosa</em> or Corc Beag – the small, bristle, grey oat. These oats, along with Bere Barley and Hebridean Rye, are the last remaining cereal landraces to be found in Scotland. A landrace can be defined as a “locally adapted variety of a domesticated species of plant (or animal) which over time has become well adapted to its local environmental conditions” (SASA, n.d.).<em> </em>Cultivated year in, year out for hundreds if not thousands of years, they exist today only in the Northern and Western Isles, areas which conventional wisdom might define as peripheral. Grown as fodder for livestock, the 540 hectares of Corc Beag grown annually on the Uists make up the largest area of surviving landraces anywhere in Britain (BSBI, 2010). In many ways it’s a miracle that they still exist at all.</p>



<p>Yet these were once the major food crops of the Gàidhealtachd. If you read the accounts from early travellers to the region, it becomes apparent quite how much grain was grown here in the past. When Martin Martin (1697) visited in 1695, grains seem to have been cultivated almost everywhere, often on places where today it would be very hard to believe it possible. In giving an account of Skye for the Board of Agriculture in 1811, James MacDonald reported that of the island’s total landmass of roughly 350,000 acres, 8.5% was used as arable land. MacDonald (1811: 209, 761) claims of Corc Beag that “this grain constitutes the bread of three-fourths of the population”, and, despite the population then being almost double what it is today, that the soils of Skye should be capable of being able to “supply their present population with bread.”</p>



<p>The volume of grain being produced was only possible because this arable system worked in tandem with another agricultural practice: the Shieling system. At its most basic, the Shieling system was a form of what is called transhumance – where people and livestock would move away, beyond the boundary, from the fertile low-lying glens or in-byes, and into the out-bye land or fàsachs, and up into the hills or onto the moors where they would spend long summer months living in the àirighs or shielings, herding and milking their livestock.</p>



<p>This was an agricultural system that in many ways also held much of Gaelic lifeway patterns and cultural norms together. By and large, the Gaelic calendar year was split into two halves: the season of growth that began with the celebrations of Beltane in early May; and the season of decay that was marked by Samhain at the end of October and was also understood to be the beginning of the Gaelic new year. These calendar dates where the markers for when the transhumance could begin and end, and both dates involved elaborate festivities and rituals. The significance of this seasonal movement to Gaelic culture was enormous, as attested to by the volume of songs and stories in the archives about the shielings and summer milking.</p>



<p>As well as providing the dairy products which, along with grain, made up the bulk of the traditional Gàidhealtachd diet, there is evidence that the Shieling system was beneficial to the land. When the early travellers reported on what they found they were often describing open-park like woodland habitats, heathland, and moorland. Numerous ecologists have commented that the impacts of cattle and other livestock, if done in the appropriate way and stocked at the right density, can be beneficial to woodland ecology and biodiversity.</p>



<p>According to Frank Fraser Darling (1956), possibly the foremost 20th century ecologist of the Highlands and Islands, “The cattle husbandry and persistence of the forests were reasonably compatible and even complementary, for the cattle received shelter from the forest and the trees benefited from light cropping of the herbage floor, from the browsing and the manuring.” Writing about traditional cattle in woodland ecology in the Highlands, conservationist Roy Dennis (1998: 7-8) observes, “There is increasing interest in understanding the effects of mega-herbivores on forest ecosystems in Europe and a growing scepticism that the primeval forests were dark woodlands of densely growing trees. Instead, it is believed that fire and the large herbivores created mosaics on both large and small scales, and that in some places there were open ‘savannah-like’ wooded grasslands. … Without cattle, our forest ecosystems will not be as successful for biodiversity conservation.”</p>



<p>Echoing this point, Knepp Estate (n.d.) in the South of England, one of the primary working examples of the so-called rewilding movement, affirms that “the battle between these two opposing forces of nature – animal disturbance and vegetation succession – generates habitat complexity and biodiversity. Reintroducing some of these animals to the landscape – using domestic descendants as proxies for some of the extinct species – can have a hugely positive impact on nature.” This was to a certain extent the type of habitat that the early travellers to the Gàidhealtachd were describing: mosaics of savannah like wood pasture at various stages of succession, achieved in ways that were still healthy and dynamic. By moving the livestock into the hills and grazing in a way that was, at least in part, beneficial to the ecology of the habitat, there was an elegant, well-balanced system which made full use of the agricultural territory.</p>



<p>The territories were places that people knew intimately, as evidenced by the plethora of place names found within the Gaelic heartlands. Almost every rock and little pool or stream would appear to have had a name. But, significantly, the people here also knew how to <em>use</em> the territory in ways that are hard to envisage today.</p>



<p>The naturalist Thomas Pennant (1774) famously visited the Hebrides in 1772 to report to his readers on what he had seen. To accompany him, Pennant had brought along the botanist Rev. John Lightfoot who compiled a 1,200 page botanical survey later published in 1777. Whilst this record is mostly made up of scientific descriptions of his findings, he also included many ethnobotanical notes on how these plants were used. I still need to give the book more attention, but having gone through it I’ve found that Lightfoot noted uses for an astonishing 274 wild plants, including 92 food and drink plants, 41 dye plants, 94 medicinal plants, and 39 for fibres, building, or tanning. To me, this shows that as recent as the late-18<sup>th</sup> century, people here understood how to dwell within their territories in ways that resemble how many Indigenous peoples today relate to theirs.</p>



<p>Anthropologist Tim Ingold (2000: 147, 55) writes, “to live in the world is also to inhabit it. … Knowledge of the world is gained by moving about it, exploring it, attending to it, ever alert to the signs by which it is revealed. Learning to see, then, is a matter not of acquiring schemata for mentally constructing the environment but of acquiring the skills for direct perceptual engagement with its constituents, human and non-human, animate and inanimate.”</p>



<p>Up until last century, a very important word in the Gaelic worldview was <em>Tuath</em>. This word meant both “territory” and “the people of the territory”. The two were understood to be one and the same and inseparable. It’s my understanding that from this utterly interlinked belonging to territory you get other critical ideas in the cosmology such as <em>dùthchas</em> – an idea of belonging that is described by crofter and textile artist Alice Starmore as when “you belong to the land and the land belongs to you” (Farmerama Radio, 2021).</p>



<p>In <em>Tending the Wild: Native American knowledge and the Management of California’s Natural Resources</em>, M. Kat Anderson documents many of the different methods that the Indigenous peoples of California have used to manipulate the “wild” plants and terrains in order to promote the growth of species that were more culturally useful. In it she demonstrates that much of what would have been considered wilderness when first encountered by Europeans was in fact vast territories of carefully tended habitat that had been shaped by thousands of years of native burning, harvesting, tilling, pruning, transplanting, sowing, and scattering. The methods described don’t comfortably fit into either of the binary categories of hunter-gathering or agriculture but, rather, are better described as <em>tending</em>.</p>



<p>“Tend means ‘to have the care of; watch over; look after.’ Thus the word connotes a relationship of stewardship, involvement, and caring very different from the dualistic, exploit-it-or-leave-it-alone relationship with nature still characteristic of Western society. The role of nature’s steward was (and still is) one shared by many indigenous peoples” (Anderson, 2013: 358).</p>



<p>“The foundation of native people’s management of plants and animals was a collective storehouse of knowledge about the natural world, acquired over hundreds of years through direct experience and contact with the environment. The rich knowledge of how nature works and how to judiciously harvest and steward its plants and animals without destroying them was hard earned; it was the product of keen observation, patience, experimentation, and long-term relationships with plants and animals. It was a knowledge built on a history, gained through many generations of learning passed down by elders about practical as well as spiritual practices. This knowledge today is commonly called ‘traditional ecological knowledge’” (Anderson, 2013: 4).</p>



<p>In Gaelic this “traditional ecological knowledge” may be able to be translated as <em>dualchas</em>. Anderson continues, “one learns that Indigenous people achieve deeper intimacy with nature by using it. The character of each tree takes on new dimensions when transformed by human hands through scraping, skinning, soaking, peeling, boiling, mashing, grinding, fire hardening, splitting and decorating. … Each time a person transforms a plant, animal or mineral into a useful item it is an acknowledgement that he or she belongs to a place. … By using nature, we begin to know our place in it”<em> </em>(Anderson, 2013: 338, 363).</p>



<p>Could these ideas be encompassed in Gaelic by the word <em>dùthchas</em>? I believe it’s possible that they could.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>“The most important area of domination was the mental universe of the colonised, the control, through culture, of how people perceived themselves and their relationship to the world. Economic and political control can never be complete or effective without mental control. To control a people’s culture is to control their tools of self-determination in relationship to others.” – Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o, <em>Decolonising the Mind</em></p>



<p><em>Shifting baseline syndrome</em> is a term used in ecology to express how reference points (baselines) for what is perceived as ‘natural’ change in populations over time. Our reference points for what is natural or normal in ecosystems and biodiversity have dramatically changed over the past centuries to the point where we may now perceive highly degraded landscapes as the ‘natural’ state of things – even if the breadth of habitats and richness of biodiversity we know today are just a fraction of what once was. Partially because of this, it can be hard to imagine what our landscapes could be like if they were healthy, vibrant, and fully functional.</p>



<p>This is equally as true with cultural diversity.</p>



<p>What we see today as ‘traditional’ are the leftovers that Gaels were allowed to keep after the land-based culture here was systematically eroded and indeed dismembered.</p>



<p>Arable crops are now only grown on the more fertile eastern parts of the Gàidhealtachd; the Shieling system has long since collapsed and transhumance no longer happens; there is little of the biodiversity that there once was and the traditional knowledge of wild plant use is all but gone.</p>



<p>When the Clearances began, the Shielings were some of the first things to be removed. This was also the time when folks started to be moved away from the old, communal settlements and townships and onto small individually allotted plots of land, called crofts. In processes which starkly paralleled those imposed on many Indigenous peoples all over the world, these crofts were never designed to be able to meet all the needs of subsistence and these new, forced land arrangements pushed the Tuath – the tenantry – into the wage economy in order to survive. Until the end of the 19th century, folks would refer to themselves as the Tuath, and it was only at a later stage that they began to identify as crofters, a term of Germanic origin brought into the region in the times of ‘improvement’ and clearance.</p>



<p>When the Shieling system was beginning to decline in the 17th century, it’s important to note that it was having to coexist with newer, export-oriented systems of droving and commercial forestry. And it is at this point that you start to see evidence of habitat loss due to pressures from overgrazing, and also the extinction of keystone mammals, such as beavers, wild boar, and wolves. The reintroduction of such species is of course a key bone of contention within the whole rewilding debate.</p>



<p>According to Iain MacKinnon (Farmerama Radio, 2021) in a contribution to <em>Landed</em>, an award-winning podcast series sharing the voices behind regenerative farming, “What there has been over the course of the last 300 or 400 years, but particularly the last 150 years, is cultural devastation for Gaelic Scotland. There’s comparatively little left, both in terms of social relations and cultural norms. … We’re living in the debris of our traditional society. We’re living in the wreckage. And we need to reconstitute something from that wreckage that doesn’t exclude or fence people out but supports people to come in and be part of that reconstituting process.”</p>



<p>In order to understand how to recover and reinvigorate some of these traditional land management practices, we need to look to what we know of the ruins from the past. According to sociologist Boaventura de Sousa Santos (2018), these ruins are also the seeds for imagining a hopeful future. The ruins and the wreckage of the past are where we may find some seeds that we can remember, rekindle, revitalise, and reinvent for today.</p>



<p>Some of these ruins may be actual seeds. The Corc beag, or grey oats, that once made up three quarters of the bread foods of the Gaels are no longer cultivated anywhere for human consumption. Indeed, because they’ve been neglected or forgotten for so long as a food, the plant itself is no longer viable as a foodstuff for humans. If I were to mill their grains, I would end up with nothing but dust and husk. Even the few experts who still work with these seeds now doubt that they could ever have been eaten by humans, despite the early accounts. But the seed still exists. To tend them as a foodstuff would involve patient restoration work over a number of decades.</p>



<p>Other ruins may be things like key Gaelic cosmological ideas: Dùthchas, or a sense of belonging to the land or the territory and an interconnection with every part of life within it; Tuath, where the territory and the people of the territory are one and the same; and Dualchas, the transfer of ancestral wisdom of how to live in balance within this territory, within this place.</p>



<p>These are things that were actively dismembered, and then forgotten. But today we are at a point where perhaps it’s time to re-member and repair them. These are keystone concepts for reconstituting the Gàidhealtachd, but they are also <em>just</em> ideas if they can’t be supported by and in turn support real-life practices. The erosion of the ecology and habitats, traditional land practices, lifeways and foodways has gone hand in hand with the erosion of the Gaelic language and its ways of being. The language, the lifeways, and the ways of being on the land are like legs on a stool that hold up a people and a culture. If one falls, they all start to collapse.</p>



<p>What would a decolonised Gaelic landscape look like today? How can we work towards that now? We are living in a time where, one way or another, things are not going to stay the same. Changes in how we go about using the land are inevitable. Today, and certainly tomorrow, there are going to be more and more calls for rewilding and for crofters to change their land practices in response to the various ecological and climate crises.</p>



<p>Is now the time to start to recover some of these lost practices; these ruins of our past? By attempting to revive, repurpose, and reinvent some of these old lifeways, foodways, and ways of interacting with and using the land, we may be able to actively support some of these key Gaelic ideas and cultural practices and by doing so play a role in the reconstitution process Iain Mackinnon mentioned.</p>



<p>In <em>Indigenous Food Sovereignty in the United States,</em> editors Elizabeth Hoover and Devon A. Mihesuah (2019) write, “The concept of Indigenous food sovereignty is not focused only on right to land, food and the ability to control production systems, but also responsibilities to and culturally, ecologically, and spiritually appropriate relationships with elements of those systems. This concept entails emphasizing reciprocal relationships with aspects of the landscape and the entities on it.”</p>



<p>Rewilding is now here and – like it or not – it’s probably here to stay. Yet there is no implicit, fundamental contradiction or even tension between the actual science of rewilding and these traditional ways of being. To me, what we have is an opportunity to present a case for a return to something which could resemble an ‘indigenous’, pre-clearance approach to dwelling in the land.</p>



<p>If there’s money going into purchasing large areas of land to rewild, then we need to ask: what does rewilding look like? Crofting and rewilding are often pitted against each other in a narrative that suggests they are incompatible. But rather than opposing rewilding on the grounds that it is not compatible with the practices that were imposed on the Gàidhealtachd through colonial mechanisms, we should instead start to advocate for embedding these pre-clearance practices into the rewilding agenda and demanding that they are included, considered, and acted upon by people.</p>



<p>It is the very same people who destroyed the Indigenous cultures and land practices who are now calling for a return to the landscape they destroyed. But “Is treasa tuath na tighearna” (The people are mightier than a lord). We need to become the Tuath once more and demand that if this happens it does so in conjunction with a return to ‘indigenous’ land uses, in a relevant and reinvigorated way for today. These ideas need to be invoked now and attempts at living them need to be made. Over the centuries Gaels were domesticated into the state and maybe now is the time for the Tuath to be rewilded.</p>



<p>If folks want to buy up the land to rewild it and that genuinely is their purpose, fine. Buy it up but then give it back to the Tuath to carry this process out. This is a moment and an opportunity to try to remember and invoke these ruin seeds. To move them towards being living seeds once again.</p>

<p><em>Dougie Strang interviews Hanna Tuulikki about her new project Seals’kin, and much more.</em> This interview was published in #4 of LESS<strong> </strong>a journal of degrowth, radical sufficiency and decolonisation in Scotland. You can pick up a <a href="https://www.enough.scot/less-distribution-hubs/">free hard copy from our hubs here.</a></p>



<p><em>“Neither one thing nor another thing,”&nbsp;</em>sings Hanna Tuulikki, over and over, providing the vocals for a song on the album&nbsp;<em>Wayward the Fourth</em>&nbsp;by Daniel Padden’s The One Ensemble, released back in 2007. The refrain might serve as a useful epigraph for the body of work that Tuulikki has created since then, work that often explores the space between the human and the non-human – or more-than-human; and just as importantly, explores the possibility of communicating across that space. In a short sound-piece from 2016, she calls out to a raven in a forest in Finland, mimicking the&nbsp;<em>craak craak</em>&nbsp;of the raven’s voice and delighting in its reply.</p>



<p>Hanna Tuulikki is a singer, composer, performance-maker, and visual artist. She studied at Glasgow School of Art, graduating in 2006, and has mostly been based in the city ever since. Her work is ambitious, innovative, and lauded. It&nbsp;includes&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hannatuulikki.org/portfolio/awbirds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Air falbh leis na h-Eòin</em><em>&nbsp;/</em>&nbsp;<em>Away with the Birds</em></a>, a multi-disciplinary project investigating mimesis in traditional Gaelic song, which culminated in a live performance in a harbour on the Isle of Canna in 2014;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hannatuulikki.org/portfolio/cloud-cuckoo-island/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Cloud-cuckoo-island</em></a>, a film-performance created on the Isle of Eigg in 2016 that explores trauma, gender&nbsp;and ecology; and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hannatuulikki.org/portfolio/deer-dancer-live-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Deer Dancer</em></a>, another cross-artform project which looks at representations of deer behaviour and hunting mythologies across different cultures, and which has generated a film and exhibition, premiered at Edinburgh Printmakers in 2019, and a live performance at Glasgow’s Tramway in 2021.</p>



<p>Tuulikki’s latest project,&nbsp;<em>Seals’kin</em>, plays again with the notion of entanglement between the human and the more-than-human. A film of the project was commissioned by the Sydney Biennale, and was created by Tuulikki and her team when they spent a couple of weeks filming in January on the Aberdeenshire coast, at the point where the River Ythan meets the sea, and where colonies of grey and common seals haul themselves out onto the shore.</p>



<p>There are countless folktales, myths, and songs about seal-people, or ‘selkies’ as they are widely known. Two lines in an Orkney ballad, The Great Selkie of Sule Skerry, neatly summaries their condition: ‘I am a man upon the land / I am a selkie upon the sea’. Tales of these shape-shifting creatures, both male and female, continue to resonate in our cultural consciousness, featuring in contemporary films and novels. The poet, Robin Robertson, provides a powerful and dark re-telling of the myth in the poem ‘At Roane Head’ from his 2010 collection&nbsp;<em>The Wrecking Light</em>.</p>



<p>In&nbsp;<em>Seals’kin,&nbsp;</em>Hanna Tuulikki enacts the transformation that lies at the heart of all selkie tales. At the start of the film, we see her in traditional fisherman’s gansey and sou’wester hat, standing on the shore at the river’s mouth and singing to the seals who congregate on the opposite strand; but by the end of the film, she has shifted form and has entered the sea, swimming out and under to meet the seals. The film is mesmerising: gently-paced, beautifully shot, and with a vocal score for human voice that responds to, and at times merges with, the seals’ own singing.</p>



<p>I was keen to speak to Tuulikki about her new project and about the wider question of making art in a time of ecological crisis.</p>



<p><em><strong>Dougie Strang:</strong>&nbsp;The idea of being ‘betwixt and between’ seems to be an enduring aspect of your work.</em></p>



<p><strong>Hanna Tuulikki:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, I’m really interested in meeting points, those spaces in-between, and I’m fascinated by the idea of mimesis – the imitation or embodiment of the more-than-human, whether through vocal improvisation or choreographic movement. Mimesis as a way of thinking or feeling towards, of occupying, those hybrid spaces.</p>



<p><em><strong>DS</strong>: What’s the attraction? Is it simply a desire to communicate, or is it to foster empathy?</em></p>



<p><strong>HT:</strong>&nbsp;It’s so many things. Partly the reason for exploring this space with the body is the inability of language to actually reach those places; so it’s difficult to pinpoint the specifics, but I think empathy is a large part of it, and a feeling of ‘becoming with’, of kinship, of searching for ways to co-exisit with that which is so often considered the ‘other’.</p>



<p><em><strong>DS:</strong>&nbsp;We have a long tradition, going back into pre-history, of making art that seeks to communicate with, to ‘become with’ as you would say, the more-than-human. I’m thinking for example of the paintings in the caves at Chauvet in France. In the past, much of that art, whether paintings, music, or dance, would be part of a wider practice – what we might call Animism or Shamanism – with the specific purpose of mediating between humans and animals, primarily to ensure a successful hunt. But here we are, immersed in the modernity of the 21</em><em>st</em><em>&nbsp;century, yet it seems to me that your work is endowed with something of that shamanic tradition, and I wonder if that’s a conscious decision, and if so, to what purpose?</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><strong>HT:</strong>&nbsp;I’m really interested in this inheritance, and in exploring these practices in vernacular cultures across time and space. To go back to the word ‘mimesis’, its etymology is Ancient Greek, from Plato, who discussed mimesis in terms of the performing arts: the idea that to impersonate the qualities of a character is to make yourself vulnerable to absorbing some of those qualities. But that idea has existed outside of Western culture for aeons, and I’m interested in how we can learn from these practices in order to challenge binary Western thinking and its promotion of human/nature separation. How can we refashion that as a myriad of bodily connections? And in terms of ritual, I’ve been studying different vernacular traditions of mimesis, and seeing the disconnect between what’s encoded in these traditions and the reality of ecological and climate breakdown. So what do such traditions mean now, and how can we work with them as part of ‘the carrying stream’ to create new rituals that help to make sense of the shit-storm we are living in?</p>



<p><em><strong>DS:</strong>&nbsp;How did Seals’kin come about?</em></p>



<p><strong>HT:</strong>&nbsp;It’s one of those projects that has been hovering in my consciousness for a while, and then a few things aligned. I had the Sydney commission and I knew I wanted to work with selkie mythology, and explore what it might mean to ‘become with’ seal. Over the years, I’ve spent a lot of time watching and listening to seals, and I’m fascinated by their voices: this space between crying and singing, it’s an incredible sound.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both grey and common seals are interested in music, and I’ve spent a lot of time singing to them. They come up the Clyde you know, right into the city. During the Glasgow COP26, Judith Williams and I invited people to learn some seal-calling songs and then we led an improvised lamentation down by the river. I told everyone that it was unlikely we’d see seals, but we went down anyway, at high tide, and literally within twenty minutes of singing, a grey seal popped up its head in the water. It was extraordinary, one of those magical moments where it felt like these songs have something special embodied within them, and that we were tapping into that.</p>



<p>I was learning the songs and singing with seals, and researching selkie stories, and I found that so often the songs and tales are about loss and longing – they’re bereavement allegories. Duncan Williamson, the traditional storyteller, writes about how the communities that he was learning these stories from found solace in them. If someone was lost at sea, it was a comfort to think that actually they’d gone to the kingdom of the seal-people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are also malevolent stories where selkies cause havoc with seal-hunters, or by stealing fishermen’s fish, and they seem to be more like cautionary tales, warning us humans about the necessity of co-existence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I began to wonder what these tales can teach us about how to live now, at a time of climate grief – there’s so many different words for it: that sense of despair at what’s happening. Then, last year, my best friend was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and she passed away very suddenly, and I was thrown into an extremely visceral state of grief. So the film is like a mourning ritual, as well as a mediation on loss and longing and co-existence.</p>



<p><em><strong>DS:</strong>&nbsp;I’m so sorry to hear about your friend. I wonder, is the pandemic part of it too, the collective grief at the huge disruption to society and community? Or perhaps that’s a bit facile to throw into the mix?</em></p>



<p><strong>HT</strong>: No, it was in my consciousness, of course. It’s been such a traumatic time for so many of us, and continues to be, we’ve just normalised it… we’ve normalised this pandemic, which I suppose is a useful teacher for how our base-line changes. Think about how we’ve normalised biodiversity loss, species extinction, rises in temperature, though that’s all been happening more slowly, so we don’t see it as clearly.</p>



<p><em><strong>DS:</strong>&nbsp;In the film, that moment when you enter the water in your seal skin costume, how did that feel, knowing that there were seals swimming not far from you, that you were entering their element?</em></p>



<p><strong>HT:</strong>&nbsp;Well, it was January, so it was freezing! But there was also a moment in the water that was like an invitation: seals were popping up all over the place, and I experienced a sense of shared curiosity. That also happened with the sonics: the sound of their calls throughout the filming was like an invitation for me to become more present in my body, as though I was un-numbing myself.</p>



<p>Grief is such a funny thing, you don’t know what’s going to happen the next day or the day after, and I became acutely aware of entering this liminal space, one where you’re simultaneously numb to certain things, but also incredibly sensitive to others; and there was something about that, that I was exploring in relation to skin and to bodies, and to the selkie transformation. The seal skin for me was about agency, and while making the film I had a strong sense of personal transformation. It’s equivocal of course, we can read into it what we want, but for me that ritual of immersion, of swimming, was about un-numbing and giving myself permission to transform; and the skin is like the site of that transformation: there’s the selkie skin, but there’s also my human skin, feeling through the water; this shared visceral feeling between myself and the seals.</p>

<p>t the end of filming, I was swimming in the water and we were running out of daylight, but at that moment there were seals everywhere, some just a meter away, and it was such a magical experience.</p>



<p><em><strong>DS:</strong>&nbsp;Did you have any fear with that? Seals can be fierce!</em></p>



<p><strong>HT:</strong>&nbsp;There was some concern amongst the film crew because there had been recent, local reports of dogs entering the water and being attacked by seals. But it’s funny, I didn’t have fear, even though I didn’t, initially, realise how present the seals would be. I think as long as there’s respect, as fellow-beings, there’s a kind of energy. Maybe that’s a romantic perspective, but it’s how it felt to me.</p>



<p><em><strong>DS:</strong>&nbsp;I’m curious to know if you were able to be fully present during the experience whilst, at the same time, playing a role as a performer who is making a film. I wonder if there were moments where it felt like you really slipped those boundaries?&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><strong>HT</strong>: Because I was filming over a number of days, it became like a durational practice or performance, like attending a ritual space where you’re just doing your thing, but filming it. So when all the seals were popping up it was a genuine connection – they were responding to the singing – and the moments in the film where you pick that up, those are the moments when I’m feeling it too. When you have an encounter with a seal, when you look into each other’s eyes, that curiosity, that’s a very ancient connection. It’s difficult to talk about, but it’s very real.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Nowhere are the ideas of perpetual growth more embedded and more destructive than in our food economy, in which the only metric for ‘success’ is endless growth, export sales, and a ‘productivity’ without recourse to any meaningful sense of quality. The alternative to this is explored here by D<strong>iana Garduño Jiménez</strong> and <strong>Abi Mordin</strong> who describe their “quiet farming revolution” starting in South West Scotland in which farmers across the region have formed a network to exchange knowledge, experience, and practice in the journey to a “regenerative farming”.</em><br>This article was published in #4 of LESS<strong> </strong>a journal of degrowth, radical sufficiency and decolonisation in Scotland. You can pick up a <a href="https://www.enough.scot/less-distribution-hubs/">free hard copy from our hubs here.</a><br></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>“We’re not going to change anything until we start talking and reaching those outside of our echo chambers.”</em></p><p>– Abi Mordin, Agroecologist and Facilitator&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>A quiet farming revolution is starting in South West Scotland. Farmers across the region have formed a group to share knowledge, experience, and practice in the journey to a more sustainable, climate- and nature-friendly way of farming.</p>



<p>The project started in 2021 as part of the Fork to Farm Dialogues – a global project organised by Nourish in the run up to COP26 (the 26<sup>th</sup> United Nations climate change summit convened in Glasgow). The dialogues aimed to bring farmers together with local authority and policy officers, to provide a space to talk about agriculture and climate change.</p>



<p>The dialogue in South West Scotland was organised and facilitated by Abi Mordin, Agroecologist and Facilitator working for local and sustainable food systems as part of Propagate. While most dialogue sessions were held online due to COVID-19, the group also organised two socially distanced Farm Walks in August 2021.</p>



<p>Abi began by writing two informational flyers inviting people to join – one for farmers and one for local authorities. To reach as many farmers as possible, Abi sent flyers to regional networks who were in touch with farmers and land managers. She also used social media, for example, by posting on Facebook groups dedicated to farming materials. To reach local authorities, Abi invited people from relevant departments and asked them to share the invitation with others. The flyers contained a survey link to help Abi find out more about the participants and understand their interest in the project. The group grew to over 50 participants, connected by regular email contact and the monthly online discussions.</p>



<p>Abi did not know most of the people who joined the dialogues – “If I was just going to talk to people that already agreed with me, I’d feel like I was wasting my time.”<em> </em>As an agroecological farmer herself, the range and diversity of attendees was exciting. Abi felt it was critical to move away from a “language of blame” and to understand the broader context in order to engage with different farmers:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>“Today we’ve got these polarised views, and there are these antagonistic camps of, kind of, vegans versus farmers, and rewilders versus farmers, and, you know, farmers feeling like everyone’s just having a go at them. We’re working with people who, especially in this area, are livestock farmers &#8230; most of them feel like they’ve been told that they’re a problem. And &#8230; you know, being told you are a problem when you’re referring to many, many, many generations of somebody’s culture and heritage is not helpful. So, we need to be able to use language that engages these people in a positive way. &#8230; It’s nobody’s fault &#8230; farmers are farming the way they farm is &#8230; because of policy decisions, because of subsidy provisions.”</em></p><p>– <em>Abi</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Abi ensured there was always at least one local authority representative in each session, although it was not always the same person. The broader context in which national policy shapes agriculture in Scotland was a reason why local authorities might not have been as engaged – “Agriculture, it’s national policy, but it’s also a very local issue &#8230; it’s a tricky one to navigate.”<em> </em>Nevertheless, relationships were formed. One particular local authority contacted her to collaborate on developing their communications in ways that would not alienate farmers.</p>



<p>The Farm Walks were critical for meaningful engagement, and proved to be very popular. The first visit was to Torr Organic Dairy Farm near Auchencairn, the second to Caldwell’s Veg near Girvan.</p>



<p>“<em>Could we get a lot more farmers and land managers to farm like this? While it takes time to get there, I think it looks good as an option (potentially financially as well) for whatever subsidy becomes for farmers post-2024.”</em></p>



<p>– <em>Attendee at Torr Farm Walk</em></p>



<p>At both Farm Walks, Abi facilitated a visioning session. “This did put people out of their comfort zones a wee bit!” Each session asked the group to imagine it was 2045, and that at COP26 in November 2021 amazing things had happened: World leaders had come together to agree to radically decarbonise the economy, and farmers had collaborated to fast track agroecology. What do our food and farming systems now look like, smell like and taste like? What people are there and what jobs are they doing?</p>



<p>The discussions from the visioning were captured by an artist, who used the ideas from the group to create a hand-painted image. This image has since been produced as a 28 piece jigsaw, and is used at community events to start conversations on our food and farming futures.</p>



<p><strong>Looking Forward</strong></p>



<p>After COP26, the group took some time to reflect and think about where it wanted to go. Everyone agreed it had been successful and wanted to continue.</p>



<p>A new name was born from suggestions by the group, and it’s now known as the Regenerative Farmers Network for South West Scotland. They agreed not to remove the local authority representatives, as it’s important that this work continues to connect with local policy.</p>



<p>Since January this year, Abi has been producing a weekly email, themed around different aspects of regenerative and nature friendly farming. The email group is open to any farmer in South West Scotland to join and participate in. So far the group has grown to 110 members, with new members joining each week. “The aim is to get conversations going, encourage people to ask questions and share ideas. People respond most to soil – this seems to get folk really excited and curious!”</p>



<p>There’s also a new Facebook group of the same name to provide an additional way for farmers to share and connect.</p>



<p>A Farm Walk has already been held, in partnership with Pasture for Life Scotland. The group visited Balsar Glen near Girvan, who practice mob grazing – moving the livestock daily to nourish soil and animal health – with their herd of Herefords and Aberdeen Angus cattle. Attendees really valued “seeing the local reality and hearing the experience first hand”, and “seeing different farming techniques in practice and meeting others”.</p>



<p>More Farm Walks are planned – in May the group are visiting Trostrie Farm near Twynholm to hear about innovative approaches to using sheep in a mob grazing system, and in July there is a visit arranged to a 1acre walled garden near Laurieston, Castle Douglas, which has been producing organic fruit and veg for over 40 years.</p>



<p>The group are also planning to carry out a collective soil monitoring and observation project, using the Soil Mentor platform to collect information on soil health and biodiversity, and farmers can use it to benchmark and compare each other’s interventions and management.</p>



<p>“I’m excited for the future”, Abi says. “More Farmers are coming on board now to whom this is totally new – it’s gaining traction and facilitators and practitioners like me can see the change. We’re not alone! Great projects like Agroecology: Facilitating Mindset Change have happened across Scotland and paving the way for a healthier, equitable, and food future that’s ultimately better for all of us”.</p>

<p><br>In their focus on mining in Galloway, <strong>Annie Morgan</strong> and <strong>Nayab Khalid</strong> look from the particular to the global to talk of Martin Arboleda’s “planetary mine”. This thread is a recurring one of rooting action in place and time but drawing back to see a wider and deeper picture. For Morgan and Khalid, Arboleda’s “concept of ‘global colony’ with interconnected infrastructures and technologies that transverse the entire globe … highlights the importance of understanding and challenging the extractivist model as a whole”.<br><br>This article was published in #4 of LESS<strong> </strong>a journal of degrowth, radical sufficiency and decolonisation in Scotland. You can pick up a <a href="https://www.enough.scot/less-distribution-hubs/">free hard copy from our hubs here.</a><br><br>“<em>So, while for the adivasis the mountain is still a living deity, the fountainhead of life and faith, the keystone of the ecological health of the region, for the corporation, it&#8217;s just a cheap storage facility.</em>”</p>



<p>&#8211; Arundhati Roy, speaking about the adivasi communities in south India and their struggle against mining corporations [1]</p>



<p>The slogan ‘Think Global: Act Local’ has meaning in the recent campaign against exploratory mining in Dumfries &amp; Galloway run by the grassroots group Galloway Against Mining (GAM).&nbsp;</p>



<p>In late 2021, JDH Exploration &#8211; a subsidiary of the Australian mining company Walkabout Resources &#8211; began exploratory drilling operations in Dumfries &amp; Galloway, after being granted exploration licences from the Crown Estate in 2018. The area of exploration covers the proposed Galloway National Park, and includes Blackcraig Wood, a UNESCO biosphere region and an area of astounding natural beauty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Galloway Against Mining was established in early 2022 following alarm surrounding exploratory drilling activity in the Blackcraig area. Currently at around 1400 members, including local people and supporters, GAM focuses on on-the-ground activism and raising awareness.</p>



<p>We spoke to GAM member Kenny Campbell for this article. Kenny is a resident of Newton Stewart, and only found out about the drilling activity (similarly to other GAM members) in January this year. Kenny described the process of discovering the mining activity as “traumatic”, with residents waking up one day to drilling activity “essentially in their back gardens”. One of the residents, an elderly lady, “felt like she was being assaulted”. Kenny has expressed frustration at the opaque nature of the mining and exploration process, stating “you’re not sure where the next bore-hole location will be”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In January 2022, Walkabout Resources (WR) took full ownership of JDH Exploration, after acquiring the remaining equity in an Earn-In Agreement. The acquisition gives WR 100% ownership of more than 750 square kilometres of exploration licences in southwest Scotland, which includes what they are calling ‘the Blackcraig Lead-Zinc-Silver Project’ within the Crown Estate in D&amp;G. WR are an Australian based mining company, listed on the Australian Stock Exchange.&nbsp; The choice of the name Walkabout is also indicative of the appropriation of the Australian Aboriginal tradition. This immediately raises the question of bringing the resource curse to Scotland: who will benefit, distant shareholders?&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>“I have nothing against mining, many of my ancestors were miners. What I am against is companies coming in and destroying our landscape for their own gain with little to no care or respect shown to the locals or the local wildlife. The promise of &#8216;jobs&#8217; and &#8216;we haven&#8217;t broken the law yet&#8217; is not enough to sway me.”</em></p><p>– Adam Walsh, Galloway Against Mining</p></blockquote>



<p>We spoke to a local nurse involved with the campaign who wished to remain anonymous, she expressed concerns about the impact on health. Historically mining is notoriously toxic, and damages both human and ecosystem health. While JDH/WR claim that modern mining practices are ‘designed to avoid the unfortunate practices of the past’, it is worth noting that even modern metal mining &#8211; especially gold mining &#8211; produces toxic pollution. Toxic sodium cyanide remains the primary reagent for gold processing because it alloys for efficient extraction of low-grade gold ore.</p>



<p>There is also anxiety about damage to water supply in the region &#8211; Soltway Firth, North Channel, River Cree, as well as concerns about the impact on biodiversity and birdlife (starlings).&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is worth noting here that GAM are not the only group formed as a reaction to the exploratory drilling in D&amp;G. The Galloway Mines Action Group (GMAG) were also formed in early 2022, and seek to have a more formal status as a ‘regulator’ instead of the on-the-ground activism of GAM. They are in the process of registering with OSCR, with acting chair Christopher Glen and acting secretary Susan Miller.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>“Galloway Mines Action Group (GMAG) has been established to confront the challenges posed by Walkabout Resources mining activities across Galloway. GMAG has concerns about toxic pollution, radioactive release, ecological damage and the destruction of historically and culturally important sites and protected habitats and is seeking to protect Galloway from irresponsible mining. We are principally a research based group which will produce evidence to inform the decision making processes, in particular any formal planning applications, and provide information to enable individuals, stakeholders and mining interest groups to form their own views and respond effectively to proposals.”</em></p><p>– Susan Miller, Galloway Mines Action Group&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p><strong>Public relations exercises</strong></p>



<p>In order to diffuse public tensions in D&amp;G, JDH Exploration have held a series of public meetings and consultations beginning in January 2022, organised in tandem with community councils. These meetings, dubbed by locals as ‘public relations exercises’ talk up the transition to ‘clean energy’ required to mitigate against climate change and include the promise of local employment. Globally, Walkabout Resources place themselves as key players in ‘green transition’ metal mining and the recent public consultations in D&amp;G focused on this. JDH Exploration community liaison officer Nigel Bradley introduced the notion that WR have an essential role in critical metal mining for a green transition.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Despite much research I have yet to come upon a verifiable “good news” story about the impacts of mining on local communities &#8211; so it will take a lot to convince me that mining in D&amp;G should go ahead.”</em></p>



<p>– Peter W., Galloway Against Mining</p>



<p>Nigel Bradley also discussed how Walkabout Resources graphite mining operations in Tanzania (operating as Lindi Jumbo Ltd) brought benefit to the community. The reality is very different &#8211; Tanzania remains one of the poorest countries per capita income in the world. The graphite mining operations in Tanzania carry the narrative of improving infrastructure and building health centres and schools. The narrative excludes the environmental impacts of their mining and the severing of people from land and traditional agricultural methods.</p>



<p>According to Bradley, throughout the exploration process the company has consulted with D&amp;G Council, Forestry and Land Scotland, Cree Valley Community Council, Scottish Environment Protection Agency, private landowners, and local media outlets. However, many D&amp;G residents claim that there has been a lack of transparency in these consultations, and environmental assessments have not been made publicly available. The public meetings beginning in January this year were the first time locals have been made privy to any details about the operation.</p>



<p>The ‘public relations exercises’ also emphasised that the company is at the ‘exploration’ phase, i.e., drilling is a number of years away and may not be progressed. There is no mention of the environmental costs of exploration and the often little provision for restoration. The UNESCO site classification has also not offered protection in what is being described as exploration of ‘green transition’ metals and minerals. The promise of local employment has also been reiterated many times in the public consultations, but if there is one thing post-industrial Scotland knows well it is that mining jobs are often a myth.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“The jobs never last.”</em></p>



<p>– Kenny Campbell, Galloway Against Mining</p>



<p>JDH Exploration have recently completed collecting both bore-hole and top-soil samples from their exploration sites, and these have been sent to laboratories in the Republic of Ireland for analysis. Results were expected in February 2022 but have not yet been forthcoming. According to Kenny, the delay in results being made available might imply that the company is preparing their application for a mining permit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>GAM members have expressed frustration about the lack of support residents and activists have received from local politicians and council members. Kenny has pointed out that local councils have often assisted JDH Exploration by providing a venue for their public meetings. While sympathetic, South Scotland list MSP Emma Harper and councillor for Mid Galloway and Wigtown West Katie Hagmann have both indicated that action can only be taken at Scottish Government level if a full mining permit is applied for.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The Planetary Mine</strong></p>



<p>For 500 years European colonialism and the mechanisms of postcolonialism &#8211; i.e., extractive colonialism &#8211; have resulted in making our entire planet a colony. Now ‘green colonialism’ threatens the existence of frontline indigenous communities in a similar way. We borrow concepts from Martin Arboleda’s ‘Planetary Mine’ [2] and aim to describe antidotes to the precarious situation we have arrived at. A true and international sustainability, beyond extractivism, and a call to environmentalists to understand the importance of the structural, socio-economic, systemic changes necessary.</p>



<p>Arboleda’s analysis goes beyond colonialism and postcolonialism, and develops the concept of&nbsp;</p>



<p>‘global colony’ with interconnected infrastructures and technologies that transverse the entire globe, and hence highlights the importance of understanding and challenging the extractivist model as a whole. This approach connects global communities, and Arboleda takes heart in the fact that resistance to mining can re-establish ways of living that are in balance with nature, placing human concerns on an equal footing with other species. In tracing the intersecting transfer of minerals and metals from the colonised countries of South America to the growing cities of East Asia, he explores the ongoing ‘resource curse’ evident in the lack of benefit in the countries of primary extraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We acknowledge the necessity of breaking from fossil dependence for energy but question the position of transnational companies, including fossil fuel corporations, and the infinite growth model. The urgency towards addressing the climate crisis cannot be overstated, but replacing fossil extraction with the renewable narrative does not change the reality of exploitation of land and people. Use of force, environmental impacts, degradation of soil, depletion of water, tailing disasters &#8211;&nbsp; the list is long. It is not just mine workers whose health is destroyed but whole communities, with peri-urbanisation and urbanisation, mining and shanty towns severing people from land, family and community, and so on. Violence and conflict are integral in the imposition of mining throughout the majority world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is vitally important that the environmental movements recognise that changes are not just required in terms of carbon emissions reduction. Since extractivism is fundamentally rooted in injustice, solutions must go beyond the ‘extractive frontier’ [3] and look into reduction in demand. Reducing primary demand in countries with no processing facilities is a priority and structural transformation is required to challenge the growth model. A shift away from Gross Domestic Product and the pursuit of profit as an aspiration and indicator of wealth is necessary. Reducing demand for energy is key.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mining is one of the main pull factors in urbanisation, the large-scale transition and centralisation of people and resources. The exponential rise of cities and megacities globally creates more demand for energy which in turn accelerates the expansion of mining – a vicious circle. Very high levels of consumption, the concentration of economic activity, sealed surfaces (roads and buildings) which absorb and retain solar irradiation, air conditioning, cars and road freight all exacerbate climate damage.</p>



<p>The recent drive to locate mining in the ‘Global North’ where it is argued that regulations and new mining technologies will alleviate harm does not hold up. Eastern Europe has the second most devastating tailing incident on record. Turkey had a tragic mining accident in 2014, the Soma mine explosion killed 301 people and President Edrogan was reported as saying that death went with the job [4]. Mount Ida in North West Turkey, a sacred mountain in ethnic and religious traditions and an area of breathtaking beauty, is currently the site of Canadian mining. The Sampi regions of North Scandinavia, home of the Sami peoples, are increasingly under threat from mining activities. In Portugal and Serbia, conflict over planned Lithium mining is current [5].</p>



<p>It is also helpful to understand the process of colonialism in Scotland and Ireland here. Currently 27% of the Republic of Ireland is given to mining concessions and 25% of Northern Ireland [6]. The colonial history of the Celtic lands is pertinent within the concepts explored above: the Highland Clearances (as well as the Lowland Clearances), the forcible removal of crofters from land, the devastation of culture and historic agricultural practice &#8211; so well illustrated in John McGrath’s acclaimed theatre productions ‘The Cheviot, the Stag and the Black Black Oil’, dispossession, forced evictions, emigration, urbanisation, the Colonial famine in Ireland.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Natural capital</strong></p>



<p>In 2013, Sian Sullivan [7] voiced concerns about the International Union of the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) adopting the term ‘natural capital’ amid growing concerns around the promotion and promises of the ‘Green Economy’. Quoting Einstein, “we cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them”, Sullivan expressed concern that economic language rather than ecological language was prominent in the adoption of ‘natural capital’ discourse. More recently, George Monboit described how the language of markets has changed how our obligations to land have become embedded in commercial relationships.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is relevant in the Scottish context. Mairi McAllan, the Scottish Minister Environment, Biodiversity and Land Reform, used the term in response to concerns that changes to the Land Reform Bill in 2023 will not go far enough in enabling communities to lead their own development. Ms McAllan told MSPs in December 2021 that the Land Reform Bill ‘offers opportunities to take action to increase levels of natural capital value to harness ways to benefit communities’. She suggested further that it is important to find pathways that balance the need for private sector investment with legal commitments to a ‘just transition’ in land ownership and use. While a commitment to a diverse pattern of land ownership as well as public ownership of community land is the stated aim of the Land Reform Bill, her comments also included the assertion that the focus of the reform is on how land is used rather than the wider question of foreign ownership.</p>



<p>Currently, Scotland has one of the most unequal land ownerships in Europe, with just 500 people owning more than half of the land. Investigations by The Ferret [8] in 2020 revealed that 60% of foreign-owned land in Scotland was bought by companies based in tax havens. Many Russian oligarchs also own large estates. Vladimir Lisin, who got very very rich from steel extraction and ripping off Russian workers after the collapse of the Soviet Union, received public money to the tune of £700,000 for his estate near Crieff. On the Cowal Peninsula, Vladimir Strzhalkovsky, the former CEO of Norilsk Nickel, bought the historic estate while his main residence is in the tax haven of Monaco.</p>



<p>Perhaps this is why Andy Wightman, now sitting as an Independent MSP, says that fundamental reforms to land have not yet been embraced by the Scottish administration. This is not to suggest that Land Reform legislation is not important. The Scottish Government’s Land Reform Act of 2003 paved the way for community ownership in North Harris, Eigg, Gigha, Knoydart, Assyant and others. Community Land Scotland questions the so-called ‘Green Lairds’, millionaires with wilderness/rewilding projects in mind. These privileged elites are intending to live out their visions of conservation in an artificial creation. This could continue the process of excluding people from the land.</p>



<p>Returning to Galloway, the internal colonisation of land is apparent in how the Australia-based Walkabout Resources is currently exploring Crown Land. According to Kenny, the current mining issue is “really is about land reform and nothing else”. The GAM campaign to prevent the exploitation of people and land by a foreign company is of timely significance. Communities leading their own vision for developing their environments is vital.</p>



<p><em>“There would be no mining if the land was not made available. Perhaps the main focus of your efforts should be channelled there. Name and shame the landowners for starters.”</em></p>



<p>– Peter Horsell, Galloway Against Mining</p>



<p><strong>Solutions</strong></p>



<p><em>“We live in capitalism. Its power seems inescapable. So did the divine right of kings. Any human power can be resisted and changed by human beings. Resistance and change often begin in art, and very often in our art, the art of words.”</em></p>



<p>― Ursula K. Le Guin</p>



<p>Around the world communities are rising up and pushing back the frontier of extractivism and implementing solutions rooted in reducing demand and restoring ecological balance. Calls for a mass movement are frequently referred to in eco-socialist literature. The current campaign in D&amp;G can inform what needs to happen and build solidarity networks for empowerment. Community land based solutions are key. This can mean land reform and moves towards public ownership of land, housing, transport, energy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Beyond protest, the challenge is to build meaningful alternative economies. Quoting Colin Macleod (GalGael Trust, Pollok Free State), “That was protest, this is building.” The trade union movement could be at the forefront in this, going beyond ‘jobs at any cost’ to climate jobs within a just transition &#8211; a transition rooted in global climate justice, recognising the importance of international organisations like Trade Unions for Energy Democracy and Yes to Life No to Mining.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Back in Galloway, our conversation with Kenny Campbell included ideas around sustainable and heritage tourism, book festivals &#8211; including the famous Wigtown Book Festival, nature walks, ecological restoration vacations &#8211; possibly alongside organisations like Worldwide Opportunities on Organic Farms (WWOOF). Kenny stressed the importance of alternative affordable accommodations such as bunkhouses, independent hostels, and yurts.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“[We need] an underlying solutions focused approach that addresses climate change and environmental destruction, so approaches that involve sustainable development such as properly connected public transport, sustainable tourism like the Book Festival and the TRAD Music Festival, heritage such as The Museum and the various activities in Whithorn and beyond, accommodation like the various bunkhouses.”</em></p>



<p>– Kenny Campbell, Galloway Against Mining</p>



<p>This is all facilitated by integrated public transport, so the need for a better public transport system in rural D&amp;G was stressed. The solutions around public transit connecting urban and rural towns and villages can bring a sharing of locally based initiatives around growing and making, alongside the sharing of vision and support.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“One of the biggest areas of land on these islands, D&amp;G needs good, reliable and affordable public transport . Sadly this has not been the case, mainly since Thatcher&#8217;s privatisation in the 80&#8217;s &#8211; which saw prices increase 300%, and the closing of the Dumfries to Stranraer railway line back in the 60&#8217;s. Campaigns like &#8216;Haud the Bus D&amp;G&#8217;, and another to reinstate the railway line are gathering pace, giving many in the region a voice that needs to be heard. Sadly listening and making it easy for a mining company to threaten the environment of the area&#8217;s stunning landscapes and ecosystem is more of a priority for some. “</em></p>



<p>– Danny Alderslowe, local activist and campaigner</p>



<p>GAM have connected with organisations like the London Mining Network, and are keen to forge connections with other like-minded people. They learn from and support the struggles of indeginous communities around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“We are very far from alone in our struggle with Walkabout, and there are communities large and small across the globe defending their land just as we are.”</em></p>



<p>– Kenny Campbell, Galloway Against Mining</p>

<p>Words by Iain Mackinnon. Illustration  by Pearse O&#8217; Halloran.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Let me begin by stating something that might seem obvious: isolation is an important tool, and a devastating result, of colonization. …the colonized society as a whole is made to think of itself as entirely alone in the universe – completely vulnerable and unprotected. At the individual level colonised people learn to hide their real feelings and sincere beliefs because they have been taught that their feelings and beliefs are evidence of ignorance and barbarity. … This strategy of colonialism is designed to break down any resistance by persuading the colonized people that not only are they powerless to resist, but that they would also be naïve to attempt to do so.” – Erica-Irene Daes,<em> The Experience of Colonization Around the World</em></p></blockquote>



<p>In this essay I consider two important poetic invocations of the Gaelic Otherworld that deal with isolated figures struggling – and without human support – to understand and bring back to reality their own and their culture’s sincere beliefs and feelings. One is Sorley MacLean’s <em>Uamha ‘n Òir</em> [‘The Cave of Gold’], a poem of resolute struggle and despair which has variously haunted, plagued, and inspired me for fifteen years.</p>



<p>The other is Myles Campbell’s <a href="https://www.seall.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/And-So-Somersault-090721.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Agus Mar Sin Car a’ Mhuiltein</em></a> [‘And so Somersault’], which was published in a limited edition run last year through the good offices of two Skye-based organisations: arts promoter <a href="https://www.seall.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEALL</a> and arts group <a href="https://atlasarts.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atlas</a>. The human ecologist and land reformer Alastair McIntosh has argued that not only is Campbell’s poem heart-rendingly beautiful, but that it “merits a place amongst Scotland’s most distinguished mythic and religious poetry.”</p>



<p>I agree, and I am grateful to Alastair, to Myles and to Catherine MacPhee of Harlosh on Skye for our discussions last summer on what the poem brings to the world.</p>



<p>I also would like to thank Meg Bateman, Liam Campbell, Ryan Dziadowiec, Decker Forrest, Ullrich Kockel, Alastair McIntosh, Michael Newton, and Andrew Wiseman for conversations over the years that have helped clarify some of the views I take responsibility for here. I particularly want to thank Chrissie Gillies of Raasay for sharing some good and forthright views on Gaelic poetry during a land reform and ecology training session held at the Shieling Project in May 2022. It was her contribution that finally, I think, pushed me to publish my own thoughts.</p>



<p>My essay has a strong masculine bias. In this instance, it is the case that the poetic struggles analysed here to reclaim the ‘hill’ – the creative crucible of the Otherworld power of faery – from cultural invasion were both carried out by men. I have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFAh1y41VCU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elsewhere</a> focussed on the poetry of a woman bard from Skye, Catriona Montgomery, who has, in her own particular style and register, delineated in subtle ways that have yet, I believe, to be fully recognised how cultural invasion devastates the social and self-understanding of a colonised person and people.</p>



<p>I began this essay by quoting Erica-Irene Daes, a United Nations special rapporteur on indigenous peoples and a key figure in the preparation of what became the 2007 United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, because her words also emphasise the condition facing poets of colonised groups who are nevertheless moved, compelled to contribute to recovering and reconstituting their people’s lifeworld, the ground of their being.</p>



<p>In her contribution to the collection of essays <a href="https://www.ubcpress.ca/reclaiming-indigenous-voice-and-vision" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Reclaiming Indigenous Voice and Vision</em></a>, Daes holds that “one of the most destructive of the shared personal experiences of colonized people around the world is intellectual and spiritual loneliness.”</p>



<p>“From this loneliness comes a lack of self-confidence, a fear of action, and a tendency to believe that the ravages and pain of colonization are somehow deserved. Thus, the victims of colonization begin, in certain cases, to blame themselves for all the pain that they have suffered.”</p>



<p>This process of internalising blame may be one means of understanding “the tragic nature of daily life in Aboriginal communities: unemployment, self-rejection, addiction, family violence.”</p>



<p>In the case of Scottish <em>Gàidheil</em>, personal loneliness and social brokenness have been compounded by a complicating psychological factor. According to one enduring critic at least, we have turned ourselves against spiritual, or Otherworld, forces that have power to support revitalisation of an indigenous lifeworld. In the book of essays in which the idea of a ‘Celtic Twilight’ was first expressed, WB Yeats remonstrated against Scotsmen who were “too theological, too gloomy” in their dealings with “the world beyond” and who had “discovered the fairies to be pagan and wicked.” “You have made the Darkness your enemy”, he concluded. In short, Yeats believed that we ill-treated the Otherworld people because we had lost respectful intimacy with them. But Yeats’ criticisms, while capturing an important truth in Scotland’s relationship with the fairies, were misplaced in their assessment of the breadth of Scottish Otherworld tradition.</p>



<p>The hero of Myles Campbell’s <em>Agus Mar Sin Car a’ Mhuiltein</em> [‘And so Somersault’] walks that wider, more generous fairy-path that has been well-trodden in the tradition, as can be seen by the gleanings collected by folklorists such as Alexander Carmichael, Rev. John Gregorson Campbell, and Rev. Kenneth MacLeod, among others. This is a path of often humorous, instructive, and, in the case of Campbell’s poem, transformative Otherworld encounter of a kind that Yeats could not see in Scotland. Yet this path was not marginal but central to the way that traditional society conceived of the world. The importance of faery has perhaps been most succinctly captured by native scholar John MacInnes who <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3377201-d-thchas-nan-g-idheal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described it</a> as “a metaphor for the imagination”: “From this shadowy realm comes the creative power of mankind.”</p>



<p>In fact, in walking this fairy path, Myles Campbell and his poem’s hero instruct Yeats in the transformative possibilities of faery. After all, didn’t Yeats’ wandering Aengus, having once seen the fairy woman “with apple blossoms in her hair”, spend the rest of his days “wandering through hollow lands and hilly lands” to find out “where she [or, perhaps, <em>sìdhe</em>] has gone”?</p>



<p>Yeats’ famous poem concludes with the bereft but still striving Aengus dreaming of kissing her lips and holding her hand, tasting “the silver apples of the moon, the golden apples of the sun” for eternity. It’s not clear what kind of a gift Aengus would ultimately gain from the Otherworld apples of the fairy woman, but the poem is clear that she’s kept them from him until now. Perhaps he reminds us a little of RD Laing’s <a href="https://archive.org/details/politicsofexperi0000lain_t6g8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">injunction</a> towards “the young man who sets off in a yacht in search of God” or of “the poet who mistakes a real woman for his muse and acts accordingly.” Laing concludes: “Let us <em>cure</em> them.”</p>



<p>Except it is not us that can provide the cure for young men like Aengus; it is <em>them</em>.</p>



<p>And so it is with the ultimately generous, life-giving Scottish fairies that take Campbell’s hero William deep into the hollow hill for a year and a day. A little the worse the wear for drink, William is on his way home over the moor from a wedding and tries to borrow a horse which takes off and finally throws him to the ground precipitating his Otherworld encounter.</p>



<p>The adventures he endures in the fairy hill are wild and often excruciating, true enough, although the pain is always tempered by the narrator’s saving humour and an uncanny sense that, as readers, we, and William, are in safe hands. Unlike Yeats’ wan, desirous, searching Aengus, the hero of Campbell’s poem returns from the fairy realm, being transformed and vitally alive, and with the faery gift of wisdom that he needed; for him, acceptance – to be able to accept the fullness of reality, of flood and calm, and of people, here and there. But even after the return there is a rub. Life goes on; the sheep need fed, and William’s new guide “the little green man” horrifies the folk back in the ‘real’ world. Yet, for William, still the stream bubbles…and so somersault, and so somersault. In this way, <em>Agus Mar Sin Car a’ Mhuiltein</em> is an extraordinary lesson of and from the transformative power of the hill.</p>



<p>I also read <em>Agus Mar Sin Car a’ Mhuiltein</em> against another story of creative descent into the Scottish Gaelic Otherworld. This is the poem of Sorley Maclean that I consider to be his most important statement, <em>Uamha ‘n Òir</em> [‘The Cave of Gold’]. Yeats, of course, used the existence of the <em>Uamha ‘n Òir</em> story in Scottish tradition – of the piper hopelessly struggling in the cave with an overwhelming Otherworld power in the form of a fairy hound – to give weight to his argument that we consider the fairies to be wicked.</p>



<p>In the original story and song, the piper bewails his lack of three hands, two for the pipes and one for the sword, in order that he can defend himself from the fairy hound. One of the ways that I read MacLean’s symbolically and psychologically profound development of the <em>Uamha ‘n Òir</em> story, is to see MacLean himself endlessly doing battle in the cave with the fairy hound of death that represents all the forces that MacLean sees invading, intruding upon and destroying the ground of Gaelic being, leading to a Gaelic Otherworld realm so contaminated with alien elements that it perversely contributes to the destruction of its own ontological basis.</p>



<p>MacLean set his poem in <em>Dùis MhicLeòid</em> – the land of MacLeod, which includes his home island of Raasay – and when the piper first enters the cave of gold the place that he leaves behind him, <em>Dùis MhicLeòid,</em> is the place of bread, flesh, and wine, of honey and spices on the lips, of bees sounding in the ears, and “love-making, the praise and the music, the sweet promises and the rewards, and the soft eloquent words of the drink.”</p>



<p>No wonder, then, that MacLean asks again and again, why would a person “leave the land and go away at all?” Exemplified by <em>Dùis MhicLeòid,</em> MacLean’s traditional Gaelic ground of being is familiar, loving, and nurturing.</p>



<p>But as the poem unfolds it becomes clear that in the time since the piper entered the cave all that is familiar, secure, and nurturing has been subjected to a scorched earth policy, and that we have contributed to it – probably related to what MacLean once harshly called “the notorious, moral cowardice of the Highlanders”. These days there is “a mean churl lord in the Dun, and the old community broken”. Maclean’s concluding lines in the version of <em>Uamha ‘n Òir</em> that he <a href="https://www.carcanet.co.uk/cgi-bin/indexer?product=9781857544527" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved for publication</a> speak to the crisis of being that he feels. In the end, and in spite of his four arms [“two for the pipes, one for shield and one for the sword”], and in spite of inspiration by music [“the sword and the shield were useless, it was the music itself that strove”] MacLean the warrior knew that he possessed “the weakness above all weakness”; he knew that the fairy hound he faced was “of the eerie dogs of death” and the situation was truly hopeless. <em>Sùil</em>, the Gaelic word for ‘eye’, also means ‘hope’, and – tellingly now written in the first person – the poem concludes bleakly:</p>



<p><em>My lack, my lack</em></p>



<p><em>with head and heart,</em></p>



<p><em>dim eye in the head</em></p>



<p><em>no eye in the heart</em>.</p>



<p>The poem’s argument of cultural devastation and ontological elimination and hopelessness is compelling and horrific, and its music still casts an awful captivating spell today, one that Yeats would surely deplore. The human consequences of this devastation are explored in Iain Crichton Smith’s essay ‘<a href="https://www.alastairmcintosh.com/general/resources/1982-Iain-Crichton-Smith-Real-People-Real-Place.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Real People in a Real Place</a>’ and, even more directly, in Norman MacLean’s unsparing autobiographical self-examination <a href="https://archive.org/details/lepersbellautobi0000macg_o6h3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Leper’s Bell</em></a>. This most talented and most wasteful of <em>Gàidheil</em> tells how his own mother had described him as a ‘changeling’. Sometimes, when the fairies steal a human child, they replace them with a changeling, a creature that appears to be the child but below the disguise is really an ancient hateful fairy which takes and takes from the parents and gives nothing in return. Norman MacLean’s creative achievements were blighted by a lifetime of alcoholism and self-destructive behaviour, the result of what he called “a hairline crack in my sense of belonging.”</p>



<p>He had been brought up, on the one hand, in the most traditional of settings in an extended family in Uist and at the head of Loch Arkaig in Lochaber permeated by a very rich oral history and literature, much of it place-specific. In <em>The Leper’s Bell</em> he wrote that recollecting from old age his childhood days by Loch Arkaig time brought him into a state where his “being was no more than another stone in the eternity of the glen.” On the other hand, after the family moved to late-industrial Govan he experienced what he called “culture shock”, being violently attacked by other boys. Before long he had internalised and was replicating the aggression and the violence he received.</p>



<p>The writing of John Lorne Campbell ultimately helped him understand his plight, caught between two forms of consciousness and fully immersed in neither. Campbell <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/strange-things-the-story-of-fr-allan-mcdonald-ada-goodrich-freer-and-the-society-for-psychical-researchs-enquiry-into-highland-second-sight/oclc/468593" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Communities where an oral tradition predominates are so much out of the experience of the modern Western world that it is extremely difficult for anyone without first-hand knowledge to imagine how a language can be cultivated without being written to any extent, or what an oral literature is like, or how it is propagated and added to from generation to generation. The consciousness of the Gaelic mind may be described as possessing historical continuity and a religious sense; it may be said to exist in a vertical plane. The consciousness of the modern West on the other hand, may be said to exist in a horizontal plane, possessing breadth and extent, dominated by a scientific materialism and a concern with purely contemporary happenings. There is a profound difference between the two attitudes, which represent the different spirits of different ages, and are very much in conflict.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Norman MacLean repeatedly renegotiated his “status between the mainstream (Scottish Lowland) culture and Gaelic culture.” He added: “I did this frequently and my oscillations proved confusing.” As he studied Celtic at Glasgow University he struggled to reconcile a pride in his gallus Glaswegian identity with his strong memories of and attachment to growing up traditionally in Uist and Lochaber.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“The vertical plane of old Lorne Campbell was birling like a U-boat commander’s periscope. The descent into madness had begun. There I was, ostensibly drinking from the pure stream of Gaelic culture in my studies, but secretly wanting to be a townie, a boulevardier among the raffish crew who inhabited the West End of the city.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Ultimately, he reached “the conclusion that this dual consciousness laid the foundation for the cultural schizophrenia that I’ve suffered all my life, and still suffer to this day.” As well as being a singer and piper, Norman MacLean was a stand-up comedian. His edgy humour was enormously popular in the west Highlands and Islands. His popularity may have been as much a reflection of social experience as that of his own personal experience.</p>



<p>Norman MacLean’s was perhaps a severe case, but the prevalence of <a href="https://www.outerhebadp.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Outer-Hebrides-ADP-Needs-Assessment-2011-General.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">binge drinking</a> and <a href="https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files/statistics/alcohol-deaths/2020/alcohol-specific-deaths-20-report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">persistently high</a> levels of <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13883246.alcohol-related-deaths-western-isles-more-twice-scottish-average/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alcohol related deaths</a> in the islands where Gaelic language and culture is least weak but rapidly contracting suggest that his disclosures may be indicative of wider cultural trauma.</p>



<p>Could it be, then, that <em>Dùis MhicLeòid</em> and the <em>Gàidhealtachd</em> as a whole have become a cave of gold? And, if so, how can we escape from the endless futile struggle and suffering that is generated there?</p>



<p>As Peter MacKay has recently shown in an insightful <a href="https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/10023/17838/Mackay_2015_Celticism_BookChapter_AAMwcover.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysis</a> of Sorley MacLean and Hugh MacDiarmid’s responses to their understandings of the Celtic Twilight, MacLean sought in his poetry “a native symbolism” independent of “purely foreign non-Celtic development[s]”. Whether or not this was a futile, unnatural quest does not diminish the brilliance of his verse. But it does have ontological implications. He <a href="https://acairbooks.com/product/books/fiction/poetry/ris-a-bhruthaich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detested</a> the Celtic Twilight (or what he could see of it) not only as “pretentious dishonest stupidity” but also as the insertion of foreign material. For him the Celtic Twilight represented “a romanticism of the escapist, otherworldly type, a cloudy mysticism” which never “bore any earthly relation to anything in Gaelic life or literature.”</p>



<p>This may be true of some of the material that he railed against and his reasons for doing so may have been sound – the focus of much of his ire was on the work of Marjory Kennedy Fraser and a song project which might, in sympathetic terms and given her collaboration with Rev. Kenneth Macleod, be considered an act of cultural translation. But what comes across is his writing about the twilight is a total rejection of it as a creative force. Might MacLean’s concerns about cultural purity and the avoidance of “non-Celtic development” in his poetry have left him battling the already infiltrated forces of his own Otherworld in the cave of gold – a self-enclosed, radiant, and spectacular amphitheatre suffused with all the victimhood and agency of capital, empire, racial, and cultural prejudice and all that had brought <em>Dùis MhicLeòid</em> to its knees and throes – in the very manner that Yeats had warned against: captivated by the idea that the Otherworld was essentially an enemy to be defeated?</p>



<p>Moreover, might a rejection of “non-Celtic development” leave MacLean without recourse to the universal knowledge that Yeats returned to again and again in his struggles to see that dim twinkling light through to a new morning? One student of Yeats <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/166/16658/writings-on-irish-folklore--legend-and-myth/9780140180015.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described</a> that knowledge as “not empirical but imaginative knowledge” which resides “at the core of reality itself, with which the supernatural worlds of folklore, legend and myth are intimately connected.” The key to a poet’s creativity may be not so much the way in which they are able to manipulate those worlds in their work; but the culturally derived, spiritually sourced awareness and attitudes which establish their way in the first place.</p>



<p>Yeats the anti-materialist said: “I have always considered myself a voice of what I believe to be a greater renaissance – the revolt of the soul against the intellect – now beginning in the world.” He gave, in his time, an Irish awareness and attitude to that larger revolution of the soul. As the enduring and relevant criticisms of the Twilight make clear, there are many ways in which the soul can stray and its revolution dwindle to what MacDiarmid called “the delightful taste of a pink sweet filled with snow”; yet as the Twilight’s enduring and relevant appeal also appears to attest, a world that deadens the soul will always face spiritual revolt.</p>



<p>Sorley MacLean himself was not immune from beguilement by foreign influences. He bemoaned that he “was foolish enough” to have once preferred John Keats to William Ross. In <em>Agus Mar Sin Car a’ Mhuiltein</em>, Myles Campbell quotes from both MacLean and Keats. This is in the sixth section of the poem in which William’s transformative suffering really begins. Although later he will endure the torments of fire in the flesh in what seems like our common imaginary of Hell, in section six William first suffers a Celtic Hell, in which his flesh and his spirit become stone, cold and unfeeling. Here, in what appears to symbolise a profound and anguished psychic transformation, he quotes from Keats’ <em>Hyperion</em>, which describes the sorrow of the Titans, the old gods of Greece, after their overthrow by the Olympians. Interwoven with Keats are two quotes from MacLean’s <em>Dàin do Eimhir</em> XVI. It may be significant that in MacLean’s original work, what immediately follows <em>Dàin do Eimhir</em> XVI are verses in which MacLean denies the existence of God. Indeed it seems to be MacLean’s Godless world – “cold, far off, bright, beautiful … a universe moving silently and a mind alone in the environs” – from which William wishes to escape back to conversation, cèilidh, and the familiarity of home.</p>



<p>Campbell’s juxtaposition of Keats and MacLean appears to me to be part of an imaginative reconciliation achieved in the fairy hill that allows him to transcend the isolation of “a mind alone in the environs”; an isolation that is, of course, the condition of the piper struggling in the psychological crucible of <em>Uamha ‘n Òir</em>.</p>



<p>If this was Campbell’s intent, his poem achieves this reconciliation without becoming lost in “cloudy mysticism” or diversionary confection. Campbell’s hero William suffers the same “loneliness and terror” in the fairy hill that Sorley MacLean, in a poem dedicated to Alexander Carmichael, describes as being at the core of MacLean’s own creative process. That is true. However, for Campbell the fairies are not a horrendous, evil extinguishing power; they are spiritual teachers, bringers of new life and understanding.</p>



<p>And this understanding of the fairies is no foreign importation. It has long, long provenance in Gaelic tradition. After analysing a series of medieval Irish Gaelic texts on the relationship between the fairies and Christianity, the eminent scholar John Carey <a href="https://celticstudies.wales/shop/a-single-ray-of-the-sun" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concludes</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Here, in closing, we have a still more audacious defence of the deities of the old religion, unique so far as I know in the literature. They are the guardian angels, the messengers of God. The pagan Irish, we are to understand, were not devil-ridden or deluded, ‘for they were faithful to the truth of nature’.”</p></blockquote>



<p>In what might be considered an act of intergenerational bardic healing, Campbell has been able to pass through the tormenting illusory gold of the cave in order to realise and recover the original restorative power that is at the heart of the Otherworld hill. In doing so he completes the journey that MacLean had begun to return to “the truth of nature”.</p>



<p>*</p>



<p><em>Uamha ‘n Òir</em> has worked on me for some fifteen years as the main ground of my understanding of how it is for the <em>Gàidhealtachd</em> and for <em>Gàidheil</em> in Scotland today. The brilliance of the poem’s depiction of that condition – which Erica-Irene Daes describes in terms of spiritual and intellectual loneliness – has an awful sense of finality, and is not an easy place to live. <em>Agus Mar Sin Car a’ Mhuiltein</em> has disturbed that sense of finality, somersaulting me towards the possibility of an acceptance of that condition that does not bring resistance to an end, and leaves hope alive too for <em>Gàidhealtachd</em> futures. For that, I already feel deep gratitude.</p>

<p><em>Forms of traditional ecological knowledge that have been erected since antiquity in Scotland are ripe for re-imagining. Col Gordon explores ways in which a renewed application of these methods can help transition to sustainable, locally-appropriate forms of agriculture in the post fossil-fuel era.</em></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“I hear the storm. They talk to me about progress, about ‘achievements’; diseases cured, improved standards of living. I am talking about societies drained of their essence, cultures trampled underfoot, institutions undermined, lands confiscated, religions smashed, magnificent artistic creations destroyed, extraordinary possibilities wiped out.” – Aimé Césaire, <em>Discourse on Colonialism</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Ever since hearing it a few years ago, I’ve been haunted by what I take to be a very important statistic. Whilst making up just 5% of the world’s population, Indigenous peoples protect and steward 80% of global biodiversity. Indigenous peoples have generally managed to co-exist in relative balance with the environments they inhabit, and which they, more often than not, see themselves as a part of. For those of us who are not among this 5%, this statistic forces us to ask if there’s a need to learn, or indeed relearn, how to live with the rest of the more-than-human world in ways that resemble how Indigenous peoples do.</p>



<p>The question that has been preoccupying me over the past couple years is what could this mean here, in Scotland, or more specifically in the Highlands and Islands – the Gàidhealtachd? I’ll situate this consideration in and amongst the hotly debated, current, and divisive issue of rewilding and how it could relate to both repeopling and cultural revival.</p>



<p>But to start, I’ll begin with a plant: <em>Avena Strigosa</em> or Corc Beag – the small, bristle, grey oat. These oats, along with Bere Barley and Hebridean Rye, are the last remaining cereal landraces to be found in Scotland. A landrace can be defined as a “locally adapted variety of a domesticated species of plant (or animal) which over time has become well adapted to its local environmental conditions” (SASA, n.d.).<em> </em>Cultivated year in, year out for hundreds if not thousands of years, they exist today only in the Northern and Western Isles, areas which conventional wisdom might define as peripheral. Grown as fodder for livestock, the 540 hectares of Corc Beag grown annually on the Uists make up the largest area of surviving landraces anywhere in Britain (BSBI, 2010). In many ways it’s a miracle that they still exist at all.</p>



<p>Yet these were once the major food crops of the Gàidhealtachd. If you read the accounts from early travellers to the region, it becomes apparent quite how much grain was grown here in the past. When Martin Martin (1697) visited in 1695, grains seem to have been cultivated almost everywhere, often on places where today it would be very hard to believe it possible. In giving an account of Skye for the Board of Agriculture in 1811, James MacDonald reported that of the island’s total landmass of roughly 350,000 acres, 8.5% was used as arable land. MacDonald (1811: 209, 761) claims of Corc Beag that “this grain constitutes the bread of three-fourths of the population”, and, despite the population then being almost double what it is today, that the soils of Skye should be capable of being able to “supply their present population with bread.”</p>



<p>The volume of grain being produced was only possible because this arable system worked in tandem with another agricultural practice: the Shieling system. At its most basic, the Shieling system was a form of what is called transhumance – where people and livestock would move away, beyond the boundary, from the fertile low-lying glens or in-byes, and into the out-bye land or fàsachs, and up into the hills or onto the moors where they would spend long summer months living in the àirighs or shielings, herding and milking their livestock.</p>



<p>This was an agricultural system that in many ways also held much of Gaelic lifeway patterns and cultural norms together. By and large, the Gaelic calendar year was split into two halves: the season of growth that began with the celebrations of Beltane in early May; and the season of decay that was marked by Samhain at the end of October and was also understood to be the beginning of the Gaelic new year. These calendar dates where the markers for when the transhumance could begin and end, and both dates involved elaborate festivities and rituals. The significance of this seasonal movement to Gaelic culture was enormous, as attested to by the volume of songs and stories in the archives about the shielings and summer milking.</p>



<p>As well as providing the dairy products which, along with grain, made up the bulk of the traditional Gàidhealtachd diet, there is evidence that the Shieling system was beneficial to the land. When the early travellers reported on what they found they were often describing open-park like woodland habitats, heathland, and moorland. Numerous ecologists have commented that the impacts of cattle and other livestock, if done in the appropriate way and stocked at the right density, can be beneficial to woodland ecology and biodiversity.</p>



<p>According to Frank Fraser Darling (1956), possibly the foremost 20th century ecologist of the Highlands and Islands, “The cattle husbandry and persistence of the forests were reasonably compatible and even complementary, for the cattle received shelter from the forest and the trees benefited from light cropping of the herbage floor, from the browsing and the manuring.” Writing about traditional cattle in woodland ecology in the Highlands, conservationist Roy Dennis (1998: 7-8) observes, “There is increasing interest in understanding the effects of mega-herbivores on forest ecosystems in Europe and a growing scepticism that the primeval forests were dark woodlands of densely growing trees. Instead, it is believed that fire and the large herbivores created mosaics on both large and small scales, and that in some places there were open ‘savannah-like’ wooded grasslands. … Without cattle, our forest ecosystems will not be as successful for biodiversity conservation.”</p>



<p>Echoing this point, Knepp Estate (n.d.) in the South of England, one of the primary working examples of the so-called rewilding movement, affirms that “the battle between these two opposing forces of nature – animal disturbance and vegetation succession – generates habitat complexity and biodiversity. Reintroducing some of these animals to the landscape – using domestic descendants as proxies for some of the extinct species – can have a hugely positive impact on nature.” This was to a certain extent the type of habitat that the early travellers to the Gàidhealtachd were describing: mosaics of savannah like wood pasture at various stages of succession, achieved in ways that were still healthy and dynamic. By moving the livestock into the hills and grazing in a way that was, at least in part, beneficial to the ecology of the habitat, there was an elegant, well-balanced system which made full use of the agricultural territory.</p>



<p>The territories were places that people knew intimately, as evidenced by the plethora of place names found within the Gaelic heartlands. Almost every rock and little pool or stream would appear to have had a name. But, significantly, the people here also knew how to <em>use</em> the territory in ways that are hard to envisage today.</p>



<p>The naturalist Thomas Pennant (1774) famously visited the Hebrides in 1772 to report to his readers on what he had seen. To accompany him, Pennant had brought along the botanist Rev. John Lightfoot who compiled a 1,200 page botanical survey later published in 1777. Whilst this record is mostly made up of scientific descriptions of his findings, he also included many ethnobotanical notes on how these plants were used. I still need to give the book more attention, but having gone through it I’ve found that Lightfoot noted uses for an astonishing 274 wild plants, including 92 food and drink plants, 41 dye plants, 94 medicinal plants, and 39 for fibres, building, or tanning. To me, this shows that as recent as the late-18<sup>th</sup> century, people here understood how to dwell within their territories in ways that resemble how many Indigenous peoples today relate to theirs.</p>



<p>Anthropologist Tim Ingold (2000: 147, 55) writes, “to live in the world is also to inhabit it. … Knowledge of the world is gained by moving about it, exploring it, attending to it, ever alert to the signs by which it is revealed. Learning to see, then, is a matter not of acquiring schemata for mentally constructing the environment but of acquiring the skills for direct perceptual engagement with its constituents, human and non-human, animate and inanimate.”</p>



<p>Up until last century, a very important word in the Gaelic worldview was <em>Tuath</em>. This word meant both “territory” and “the people of the territory”. The two were understood to be one and the same and inseparable. It’s my understanding that from this utterly interlinked belonging to territory you get other critical ideas in the cosmology such as <em>dùthchas</em> – an idea of belonging that is described by crofter and textile artist Alice Starmore as when “you belong to the land and the land belongs to you” (Farmerama Radio, 2021).</p>



<p>In <em>Tending the Wild: Native American knowledge and the Management of California’s Natural Resources</em>, M. Kat Anderson documents many of the different methods that the Indigenous peoples of California have used to manipulate the “wild” plants and terrains in order to promote the growth of species that were more culturally useful. In it she demonstrates that much of what would have been considered wilderness when first encountered by Europeans was in fact vast territories of carefully tended habitat that had been shaped by thousands of years of native burning, harvesting, tilling, pruning, transplanting, sowing, and scattering. The methods described don’t comfortably fit into either of the binary categories of hunter-gathering or agriculture but, rather, are better described as <em>tending</em>.</p>



<p>“Tend means ‘to have the care of; watch over; look after.’ Thus the word connotes a relationship of stewardship, involvement, and caring very different from the dualistic, exploit-it-or-leave-it-alone relationship with nature still characteristic of Western society. The role of nature’s steward was (and still is) one shared by many indigenous peoples” (Anderson, 2013: 358).</p>



<p>“The foundation of native people’s management of plants and animals was a collective storehouse of knowledge about the natural world, acquired over hundreds of years through direct experience and contact with the environment. The rich knowledge of how nature works and how to judiciously harvest and steward its plants and animals without destroying them was hard earned; it was the product of keen observation, patience, experimentation, and long-term relationships with plants and animals. It was a knowledge built on a history, gained through many generations of learning passed down by elders about practical as well as spiritual practices. This knowledge today is commonly called ‘traditional ecological knowledge’” (Anderson, 2013: 4).</p>



<p>In Gaelic this “traditional ecological knowledge” may be able to be translated as <em>dualchas</em>. Anderson continues, “one learns that Indigenous people achieve deeper intimacy with nature by using it. The character of each tree takes on new dimensions when transformed by human hands through scraping, skinning, soaking, peeling, boiling, mashing, grinding, fire hardening, splitting and decorating. … Each time a person transforms a plant, animal or mineral into a useful item it is an acknowledgement that he or she belongs to a place. … By using nature, we begin to know our place in it”<em> </em>(Anderson, 2013: 338, 363).</p>



<p>Could these ideas be encompassed in Gaelic by the word <em>dùthchas</em>? I believe it’s possible that they could.</p>



<p>***</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“The most important area of domination was the mental universe of the colonised, the control, through culture, of how people perceived themselves and their relationship to the world. Economic and political control can never be complete or effective without mental control. To control a people’s culture is to control their tools of self-determination in relationship to others.” – Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o, <em>Decolonising the Mind</em></p></blockquote>



<p><em>Shifting baseline syndrome</em> is a term used in ecology to express how reference points (baselines) for what is perceived as ‘natural’ change in populations over time. Our reference points for what is natural or normal in ecosystems and biodiversity have dramatically changed over the past centuries to the point where we may now perceive highly degraded landscapes as the ‘natural’ state of things – even if the breadth of habitats and richness of biodiversity we know today are just a fraction of what once was. Partially because of this, it can be hard to imagine what our landscapes could be like if they were healthy, vibrant, and fully functional.</p>



<p>This is equally as true with cultural diversity.</p>



<p>What we see today as ‘traditional’ are the leftovers that Gaels were allowed to keep after the land-based culture here was systematically eroded and indeed dismembered.</p>



<p>Arable crops are now only grown on the more fertile eastern parts of the Gàidhealtachd; the Shieling system has long since collapsed and transhumance no longer happens; there is little of the biodiversity that there once was and the traditional knowledge of wild plant use is all but gone.</p>



<p>When the Clearances began, the Shielings were some of the first things to be removed. This was also the time when folks started to be moved away from the old, communal settlements and townships and onto small individually allotted plots of land, called crofts. In processes which starkly paralleled those imposed on many Indigenous peoples all over the world, these crofts were never designed to be able to meet all the needs of subsistence and these new, forced land arrangements pushed the Tuath – the tenantry – into the wage economy in order to survive. Until the end of the 19th century, folks would refer to themselves as the Tuath, and it was only at a later stage that they began to identify as crofters, a term of Germanic origin brought into the region in the times of ‘improvement’ and clearance.</p>



<p>When the Shieling system was beginning to decline in the 17th century, it’s important to note that it was having to coexist with newer, export-oriented systems of droving and commercial forestry. And it is at this point that you start to see evidence of habitat loss due to pressures from overgrazing, and also the extinction of keystone mammals, such as beavers, wild boar, and wolves. The reintroduction of such species is of course a key bone of contention within the whole rewilding debate.</p>



<p>According to Iain MacKinnon (Farmerama Radio, 2021) in a contribution to <em>Landed</em>, an award-winning podcast series sharing the voices behind regenerative farming, “What there has been over the course of the last 300 or 400 years, but particularly the last 150 years, is cultural devastation for Gaelic Scotland. There’s comparatively little left, both in terms of social relations and cultural norms. … We’re living in the debris of our traditional society. We’re living in the wreckage. And we need to reconstitute something from that wreckage that doesn’t exclude or fence people out but supports people to come in and be part of that reconstituting process.”</p>



<p>In order to understand how to recover and reinvigorate some of these traditional land management practices, we need to look to what we know of the ruins from the past. According to sociologist Boaventura de Sousa Santos (2018), these ruins are also the seeds for imagining a hopeful future. The ruins and the wreckage of the past are where we may find some seeds that we can remember, rekindle, revitalise, and reinvent for today.</p>



<p>Some of these ruins may be actual seeds. The Corc beag, or grey oats, that once made up three quarters of the bread foods of the Gaels are no longer cultivated anywhere for human consumption. Indeed, because they’ve been neglected or forgotten for so long as a food, the plant itself is no longer viable as a foodstuff for humans. If I were to mill their grains, I would end up with nothing but dust and husk. Even the few experts who still work with these seeds now doubt that they could ever have been eaten by humans, despite the early accounts. But the seed still exists. To tend them as a foodstuff would involve patient restoration work over a number of decades.</p>



<p>Other ruins may be things like key Gaelic cosmological ideas: Dùthchas, or a sense of belonging to the land or the territory and an interconnection with every part of life within it; Tuath, where the territory and the people of the territory are one and the same; and Dualchas, the transfer of ancestral wisdom of how to live in balance within this territory, within this place.</p>



<p>These are things that were actively dismembered, and then forgotten. But today we are at a point where perhaps it’s time to re-member and repair them. These are keystone concepts for reconstituting the Gàidhealtachd, but they are also <em>just</em> ideas if they can’t be supported by and in turn support real-life practices. The erosion of the ecology and habitats, traditional land practices, lifeways and foodways has gone hand in hand with the erosion of the Gaelic language and its ways of being. The language, the lifeways, and the ways of being on the land are like legs on a stool that hold up a people and a culture. If one falls, they all start to collapse.</p>



<p>What would a decolonised Gaelic landscape look like today? How can we work towards that now? We are living in a time where, one way or another, things are not going to stay the same. Changes in how we go about using the land are inevitable. Today, and certainly tomorrow, there are going to be more and more calls for rewilding and for crofters to change their land practices in response to the various ecological and climate crises.</p>



<p>Is now the time to start to recover some of these lost practices; these ruins of our past? By attempting to revive, repurpose, and reinvent some of these old lifeways, foodways, and ways of interacting with and using the land, we may be able to actively support some of these key Gaelic ideas and cultural practices and by doing so play a role in the reconstitution process Iain Mackinnon mentioned.</p>



<p>In <em>Indigenous Food Sovereignty in the United States,</em> editors Elizabeth Hoover and Devon A. Mihesuah (2019) write, “The concept of Indigenous food sovereignty is not focused only on right to land, food and the ability to control production systems, but also responsibilities to and culturally, ecologically, and spiritually appropriate relationships with elements of those systems. This concept entails emphasizing reciprocal relationships with aspects of the landscape and the entities on it.”</p>



<p>Rewilding is now here and – like it or not – it’s probably here to stay. Yet there is no implicit, fundamental contradiction or even tension between the actual science of rewilding and these traditional ways of being. To me, what we have is an opportunity to present a case for a return to something which could resemble an ‘indigenous’, pre-clearance approach to dwelling in the land.</p>



<p>If there’s money going into purchasing large areas of land to rewild, then we need to ask: what does rewilding look like? Crofting and rewilding are often pitted against each other in a narrative that suggests they are incompatible. But rather than opposing rewilding on the grounds that it is not compatible with the practices that were imposed on the Gàidhealtachd through colonial mechanisms, we should instead start to advocate for embedding these pre-clearance practices into the rewilding agenda and demanding that they are included, considered, and acted upon by people.</p>



<p>It is the very same people who destroyed the Indigenous cultures and land practices who are now calling for a return to the landscape they destroyed. But “Is treasa tuath na tighearna” (The people are mightier than a lord). We need to become the Tuath once more and demand that if this happens it does so in conjunction with a return to ‘indigenous’ land uses, in a relevant and reinvigorated way for today. These ideas need to be invoked now and attempts at living them need to be made. Over the centuries Gaels were domesticated into the state and maybe now is the time for the Tuath to be rewilded.</p>



<p>If folks want to buy up the land to rewild it and that genuinely is their purpose, fine. Buy it up but then give it back to the Tuath to carry this process out. This is a moment and an opportunity to try to remember and invoke these ruin seeds. To move them towards being living seeds once again.</p>

<p><em><strong>Degrowth and Ecology: a Silent Planting</strong></em></p>



<p><em>Last night we launched our new issue with the magnificent <a href="https://thestove.org/the-stove-cafe/]" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stove Network </a>in Dumfries. You can pick up a copy from there, and in the coming weeks across Scotland- check the list of our <a href="https://www.enough.scot/less-distribution-hubs/">Hubs here</a> for updates, or order a bundle to help share and distribute by contacting <a href="https://www.enough.scot/less/">us here.</a></em></p>



<p>In this issue, we wanted to explore the ecological issues we face beyond the crisis of carbon. We wanted to look at the problems of biodiversity and habitat loss, species-collapse, extinction, pollution of seas and lochs and air and soil that stem from our economic system and our cycles of endless production and consumption. This issue of LESS looks at omnicide in Scotland, its history and trajectory, its drivers and its resisters.</p>



<p>At the same time, we explore how processes of degrowth and decolonisation could decontaminate this process and work towards restoration and reinhabitation. Since the first issue of LESS was published, degrowth has developed from a relatively unknown and frequently misunderstood concept into an influential part of many conversations around how we navigate from the current metacrisis to new possibilities of human flourishing.</p>



<p>In Scotland, degrowth has taken root in a modest but meaningful way. It’s been remixed, regenerated, and made local by a network of activists, artists, researchers, and communities. This has taken place alongside a flowering of related scholarship, research, and publications internationally. What is emerging is a new synthesis between critically-engaged scholarship and applied practice in which its principles are embodied. The contributors to this issue are, as in previous issues, a mixture of practitioners and activists, scholars and thinkers.</p>



<p>As we describe elsewhere, creating degrowth cultures and changing the narrative about how ‘wealth’ is created and what a ‘true prosperity’ would look like is the challenge ahead. This is a major task in a society deep in climate denial and suffering the collective trauma of Covid. But is it a challenge that comes in the wake of seismic climate failure and the UK emerging as a sort of ‘failed state’, a kleptocracy of elite rule. ‘True prosperity’ may seem an elusive and difficult aim but in the context of mass immiseration and climate failure the ruinous <em>status quo</em> is indefensible.</p>



<p>This issue of LESS explores broadly how degrowth intersects with Scotland’s ecologies: social, human, and beyond. The words <em>ecology</em> and <em>economy</em> derive from the same ancient Greek root, <em>oikos, </em>meaning the good stewardship of a family’s home. The violent, dualistic rupture of this term into two concepts set in oppositional relation to each other needs to be healed and integrated. What does this mean for us in our time and place?</p>



<p>The answers to this constitute a plurality of possibilities that unfold in unexpected ways. We have stories to draw on that hint at a richer, more complex set of relations with the worlds beyond human supremacy, a complexity explored in Hanna Tuuliki’s work. As Dougie Strang notes in his interview with the artist, with a nod to a phrase coined by philosopher and ecologist David Abram in his book <em>The Spell of the Sensuous</em> (1996): “Tuulikki’s latest project, <em>Seals’kin</em>, plays again with the notion of entanglement between the human and the more-than-human.” More-than-human because animals should not be defined as simply non-human.</p>



<p>Iain MacKinnon uncovers mythopoetic elements in the cultural heritage of the Gàidhealtachd that can resource a return to a balanced ‘truth of nature’ in the face of ontological elimination. Mutually so, Col Gordon explores forms of traditional ecological knowledge and agricultural practice that can constitute distinctive lifeways in Scottish bioregions.</p>



<p>Bringing degrowth into conversation with <em>Buen Vivir</em>, an indigenous principle and decolonial practice of ‘Good Living’ from Latin America, Katherina Richter explores the need for a metaphysics adequate to address the metacrisis: “We can see that changes to our consumption, production, and working patterns alone won’t be enough to sustain a profound transformation towards a just and sustainable world. To understand the deeper shifts that are required, we need to look at cultural aspects of socio-ecological transformations. So what would it mean to put a cosmological limit to growth?”</p>



<p>Eric Swanepoel explores similar themes with the notion of the ‘real-growth’ of <em>Biospherism</em> which he describes through the illustrative mnemonic letters of C-LIFE – C: Circular Economy, the Commons, Community, Co-operation, Collaboration, Competition; L: Land, Language, Littleness, Localism, Long-Termism; Interdependence (Independence, Individualism); F: Food, Food Sovereignty, Framing (and values), Fungi; Economy and Ecology.</p>



<p>Nowhere are the ideas of perpetual growth more embedded and more destructive than in our food economy, in which the only metric for ‘success’ is endless growth, export sales, and a ‘productivity’ without recourse to any meaningful sense of quality. The alternative to this is explored by Diana Garduño Jiménez and Abi Mordin who describe their “quiet farming revolution” starting in South West Scotland in which farmers across the region have formed a network to exchange knowledge, experience, and practice in the journey to a “regenerative farming”.</p>



<p>In their focus on mining in Galloway, Annie Morgan and Nayab Khalid look from the particular to the global to talk of Martin Arboleda’s “planetary mine”. This thread is a recurring one of rooting action in place and time, but drawing back to see a wider and deeper picture. For Morgan and Khalid, Arboleda’s “concept of ‘global colony’ with interconnected infrastructures and technologies that transverse the entire globe &#8230; highlights the importance of understanding and challenging the extractivist model as a whole”.<br></p>



<p>As well as these fragments of other worlds and alternative paths we also offer to you our poster-graphic, our map of Scotland’s top twenty worst polluters, brought to you in collaboration with <em>The Ferret</em>, Scotland&#8217;s award winning investigative journalism cooperative. Finally, Steve Rushton reviews the recently published <em>The Future of Degrowth: A guide to a world beyond capitalism</em> by Matthias Schmelzer, Andrea Vetter, and Aaron Vansintjan, in which he argues that “Scotland needs to rectify and re-imagine its relations with the countries of the Global South, blazing a trail towards a post-colonial future.”</p>



<p>In offering this snapshot of the Scottish bioregion and its cultures, practices, and possibilities, we do not seek to claim any kind of moral or nationalist exceptionalism. Rather, we argue for guarding against the flattening monoculture of globalised capitalism and its destructive impacts. This means being open to the world and to the possibilities of taking our place as an independent nation, to become a radical ludic space – what Pat Kane has described as a potential ark and laboratory in an age of global meltdown.</p>



<p>However, we are conscious of the risks involved in asserting ‘indigeneity’ in a contemporary Scottish context. Certainly, elements of the lifeways, cultures, and patterns of colonisation and clearance of the Gàidhealtachd in particular have a strong case for such a claim – and are mutually recognised as such by some Indigenous peoples internationally. However, in the context of rising ethnonationalism and the ongoing reckoning with Scotland’s active role in Empire, slavery, and colonisation, it is imperative to both stand in explicit solidarity with colonised Indigenous peoples and their ongoing resistance, and carefully differentiate the distinctions and commonalities with care. Indigenous scholars place emphasis on ‘good relations’ with regard to using knowledge or truth claims that are based in particular places and peoples. This can be sensitive when importing place-based knowledge from Indigenous nations without addressing specific Indigenous societies whose homelands are occupied – see e.g. Vanessa Watts’ ‘Indigenous place-thought’. As Métis/otipemisiw scholar Zoe Todd puts it, “we cannot take Indigenous knowledge from one place and plop it into another context without doing violence to this knowing-being.” We commit – imperfectly – to active decolonisation and explore what this means in Scotland, while being careful not to mobilise concepts from specific areas of Indigenous thought in an extractive way.</p>



<p>Learning to ‘live in place’ will become a practical necessity as re-localisation and living within the natural carrying capacity of our bioregions becomes normal as climate breakdown intensifies. This might be the subversion we need of the storied Scottish cringe: could ‘knowing your place’ transmogrify from internalised shame and inadequacy – sent out into the world as colonisation and extractivism – into authentic place-based knowledge and belonging? Could ‘reinhabitation’ be the alter to imperialism? Could bioregionalism be the counter to colonialism?</p>



<p>In Scotland, the question of independence cannot be disconnected from an understanding of Scotland as a part of the web of life. As we go to press in unprecedented and terrifying heat across Europe, every day the world is alive with flashbang-warnings of ecological breakdown. These competing spaces, <em>Other Worlds</em> both collapsing and emerging, are in open collision, not just of values and structures but in time. Nowtopias and Dystopias existing in parallel in a world of deep-level precarity.</p>



<p>It seems too late, far too late.</p>



<p>But, in Richard Power’s 2018 novel, <em>The Overstory</em>, he collects a series of tales through the lens of the lives of trees. As Douglas Pavlicek plants Douglas Fir, for a company who he realises are the same company that are cutting them down, he writes:</p>



<p>“The smell of the cuts overwhelms him. Damp spice drawer. Dank wool. Rusty nails. Pickled peppers. Scents that return him to childhood. Aromas that inject him with inexp;icable happiness. Smells that plunge him down to the bottom of the deepest welland hold him there for hours. Then there’s the sound, like his rears are wadded up with a pillow. The snarl of saw and feller bunchers, somewhere in the distance. A great truth comes over him: Trees fall with spectacular crashes. But planting is silent and growth is invisible.”</p>

<p><strong>LESS is a journal on degrowth, radical sufficiency and decolonisation in Scotland.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Issue 4: the ecology issue.</p>



<p>With Glasgow&#8217;s COP26 fading into history as another milestone in industrial civilisations&#8217; failure to reckon seriously with the root causes of climate change, the limitations of our ability to handle diffuse, complex risk becomes clearer. Our national and global institutions, predicated on an anthropocentric worldview and quasi-fanatical adherence to the goal of economic growth is undermining the basis for life as we know it, and not just for humans.</p>



<p>Degrowth and its sister term decolonisation argue that the economy as presently constructed inevitably unleashes destruction of the natural world. This is the inevitable outcome of infinite growth in a finite material world. As we’ve said “Climate crisis is manifest destiny.”</p>



<p><strong>In this issue, we explore attacks on ecosystems, biodiversity loss, habitat destruction, resource depletion and scarcity in Scotland and beyond. How do our actions and consumption impact beyond our shores? What are the critical losses we have faced and will face right here?</strong></p>



<p>How has perpetual growth and consumption undermined eroded and destroyed: land and soil; air quality in our cities; water purity in our seas and lochs and rivers; and driven some species to extinction?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But as well as looking critically and honestly at the reality of ecological disaster in Scotland we will also look at restorative practices, regenerative practical projects and movements and examples of fresh thinking which addresses the realities we are facing. Forms of traditional ecological knowledge, biomimetics, practices and lifeways that de-centre human supremacy may give us clues to live well within limits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For this issue, we seek contributions on these and related themes. We are interested in non-fiction, reportage, field reports and case studies, poetry, illustrations and photography.</p>

<p><em>Affordable access to secure, decent housing was difficult enough for many before the pandemic. Afterwards, it’s even worse. Buyers fleeing urban environments for an ‘improved quality of life’ have created a particularly overheated property market in the Highlands and Islands. Rural areas already suffering from depopulation and chronic housing shortages for locals, especially young people, are at risk of becoming even more stratified. An underground network of rebel DIY housebuilders and campaigners are fighting back, finding ways to move through the cracks of a broken system to build the foundations for housing and land for all. LESS spoke to one of them, musician and strawbale self-build advocate Craig Bryce (Brycey) about life and work on the offgrid home he shares with his family at Cannich, in a woodland clearing overlooking Glen Affric. Brycey also shares his poetical reflections on COP26. The interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.</em> Illustrations by Owen McLaughlin.</p>

<p><strong>Luke Devlin (LD): How did you get from being involved in the punk scene, underground DIY music and anarchism in Glasgow to deciding you wanted to live in the Highlands? What did you learn from DIY underground culture that helped you in that journey</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> and what lessons can you take from that kind of non-hierarchical organising in order to find these opportunities within this really dominating environment?</strong></p>



<p>Brycey (B): We became exposed to the European squat scene and the idea that you can just set up whatever you need for yourself. It obviously needed you to have a physical space for that, and that just didn’t seem possible in a flat in Glasgow. Sitting in Glasgow in our early-20s we were going, ‘Right, in order to actually make that happen you have to live on the land and with the land.’ So myself and Angus [Quinn, vocalist of Brycey’s hardcore punk band, Sedition] moved to the Highlands way back then, and had a wee go at it. I ended up at the intentional community of Talamh. That was the thing that felt for me that we’ve got a physical space, we’ve got a foothold, and we’ve got collectivisation which allows us to have a way together bigger than our own individual resources.</p>



<p>I then realised that people with no assets, if they collectivised could buy an 18th century farmhouse and 16 acres of land. We made that happen, and then we realised that we could also tap into different things by getting funding, by being in different organisations and learning in so many different ways. So we could identify a skills gap at Talamh and then try and find some way of getting someone trained to do it.</p>



<p>That just felt like an extension of the DIY underground squat thing where you would just take a building and you would just look after yourself. The one that really sticks out was The Wohlgroth in Switzerland; it had everything from a women’s refuge to a clothes shop to a metal workshop, a wood workshop, a microbrewery.&nbsp;It had everything, right in the centre of Zürich, it was unbelievable. Completely blew me away that you could just get a bunch of people organising like that. So Talamh was a bit like a university for me in terms of giving me the idea that you can do that outwith the squat scene and within the landownership situation that happens within the UK. You can kind of circumvent it, through the power of collectivism.</p>



<p>I went down the career route of getting into doing outdoor education. Both my partner and I worked for a charity called Venture Trust out in Applecross, so we were living and working there, basically helping young offenders figure out how to get out of the court system and sort their lives out by taking them out on ten day expeditions and creating your own wee tribe, creating new value systems and helping people look at their lives differently. That helped us because we didn&#8217;t need to have a house, because there was tied housing or a caravan that you could stay in, so we were able to just save all our money. That meant we could start looking for land somewhere.</p>



<p>We didn&#8217;t want to end up with loads of debt or a mortgage, so that meant we needed to do it ourselves as much as possible and with the help of other people. So far, the whole build’s been done, apart from digging out the foundations, by myself and [my partner] Ele or friends and family and volunteers. We did get a company called Straw Works to come in, pioneers in straw bale housebuilding in the UK. They put the car tyre foundations in, the straw-bale walls, all the key skill bits like that, and ran those as courses with volunteers who wanted to learn that.</p>



<p>For the other bits, we’ve just watched Youtube videos! And asked for help from other people, and you really quickly tap into another community up here because it’s normal for folk to build their own houses, it’s not an unusual thing. You talk to the woman in the shop and she says, ‘Aye, I’ve built two,’ and it’s not a big deal at all, it’s dead normal. You meet someone and they’ll say, ‘Yeah, I grew up in a caravan until I was eight because my parents were building our house,’ and all that. It&#8217;s just a thing that happens here. And when at key points you need something, like you’ve got to do an Amish barn-raising or something, 15 people will turn up who have all built their own houses and understand what it feels like to be in that position and they’ll come and help you do that. You might be from very different walks of life and have different ideas politically, but it’s like, ‘No, we know about that, we’re going to come help you do that bit of your house.’</p>



<p>With our neighbours, we’re co-operating on getting the water and services set up, and we’ve made the decision to stay off-grid. We’ll probably end up with a micro-hydro and a mixture of wind and solar for the site.</p>



<p>We’ve lived off-grid basically for eight years here. So we were feeling smug when there was a power cut down in the village! We were at my dad’s the other night and all the lights went out and my wee boy Oran’s like, ‘What’s that?’ ‘It’s a power cut, son.’ ‘What’s a power cut?’ He couldn’t even understand the concept ‘cause we’re harvesting our own energy where we are.</p>

<p><strong>LD: In terms of the build and the skills and resources that were needed, what was your starting point in terms of construction knowledge?</strong></p>



<p>B: Yeah we knew absolutely fuck all about any of it man! Ele’s quite a voracious reader, she’ll research anything she wants to get into, so she did a whole design that was like a frame with straw bale infill. And then there was a course out in Elgin that the Straw Works people ran and [Ele] became really inspired. It’s a load-bearing straw&nbsp;bale build, so the walls are actually held up by the bales, so there’s quite minimal carpentry in it and it’s quite basic. So it feels quite accessible and achievable.</p>



<p>There’s been lots of bits of it so far where we’ve been like, ‘What are we doing?!’ But again, we’ve got a friend who’s been a really good help to us and has done more traditional buildings before and was like, ‘I’ll come help you put your roof truss in’, and it’s just been like, ‘Oh yeah, that guy knows that, I’ve got a mate that knows this,’ and then just researching it.</p>



<p>If you were a roofer you’d look at our roof and go, ‘Aye that’s a bit shonky,’ and if you were a carpenter you’d look at our verandas and go, ‘Urgh.’ But we’re not bothered about that because it’s felt really empowering to do it ourselves, it’s felt like quite a primal thing to create our own home. I think the only way we’ve been able to access stuff like that’s maybe been through things like up at Carbeth to build a hut up there, and there’s a community to help you. Whereas when you get into this kind of sustainable self-build, it just feels right – part of what we should be doing as a human being.</p>



<p>We’re on year three of it, but that’s because we’re trying to do it without a mortgage, so we’re not employing any tradespeople to come in because a) we can’t afford to, and b) we don’t really want to until we really need to. If it’s got to be signed off, like electrics, then we’ll have to do that, but we’re trying to do everything ourselves, and for that to be part of the whole thing. Which means it takes a lot longer, and it’s a bit frustrating.</p>



<p>But we’ve already helped other people, we’ve met other straw-bale folk that have started on that journey and we’ve been able to go and mentor them a wee bit and give them what they need – there’s a kind of reciprocity to it.</p>

<p><strong>L</strong><strong>D</strong><strong>: </strong><strong>What more support should there be for people that are wanting to do that?</strong></p>



<p>B: There are a lot of people just doing it! And obviously they don’t want to publicise it. There are people all over the Highlands that are like, ‘Right, I’m putting something in there and I’ll wait to see if they find me.’ And there are ways of doing it where you might be like, ‘Right, my build is like a forester’s hut where I stay when I’m working in the woods,’ and then eventually it gets a change of use on it. All these things are underground and DIY, and I think the Thousand Huts campaign from Reforesting Scotland is feeding into that, there’s a lot of skills going round that, even though the flipside of that is there’s a lot of people with loads of money that are turning it into a strictly middle class or upper class pursuit almost.</p>



<p>Some folk do manage to blog it and use it as training opportunities and things like that. I don’t have space to do that, I’m barely able to be involved in anything else other than building the house, looking after my family, and doing the work I need to do.</p>



<p>It needs to be broken down for people to really repopulate and be here and live and work on the land in a way that’s beneficial and supports a lot of folk and reverses the rural depopulation trend. The Airbnb thing’s only made it worse. Young folk just cannae get a hoose. It’s not new to the Highlands, but it’s intensifying more and more. You add COVID into that and everyone leaving the cities to come to their ‘rural idyll’; and the carbon credits, Brewdog creating a fucking forest to pretend they’re carbon neutral. There’s a lot of pressure that makes landownership even more tricky to get to.</p>



<p><strong>LD: There is a challenging element to the commitment you’ve made that tests you to a certain extent, and forces you to maybe become more resilient and increase your capability in terms of exposure to taking care of your fundamental ne</strong><strong>eds in a way that isn’t about just buying a product or buying a service, because you have to do it yourself. What have been the main lessons you have learned about what really matters in life, and what are the most important things about human flourishing?</strong></p>



<p>B: The things that on the surface other folk would be like, ‘Woah, are you mad?,’ like having to go and smash the pond with a sledgehammer to get water out of it because everything is frozen solid in the middle of the winter or whatever. We could have better systems in place that would mean we wouldn’t have to do that, that’s the thing, problem solving. You can’t buy a product to do that because you’re like, ‘Right, so we need to get water from a pond all the way up the hill to come down to our caravan somehow.’ So you’ve got to problem-solve everything that way. And that, again, feels really empowering. Then when you’ve got your roasting hot, pummeling 12 volt shower and you’re like, ‘Yes, we did it!’ Now it’s broken, so I’m not boasting that much! But all those systems that we had to figure out at first, it’s just a total learning journey that makes you feel a sense of self-worth that wouldn’t happen if you were just buying a product to solve those problems.</p>



<p>We’re really lucky&nbsp;– the elements here, when it’s windy, you know it’s windy; when it’s cold, you know it’s cold. When we actually get the build finished and move in, we’re moving ourselves slightly away from that to a different level of comfort that’s going to feel really strange because we’ve lived like this for eight years now. And when it gets to the deep winter this year and it’s -10°C again, and the whole site you can’t drive a vehicle onto for maybe four months, and there’s ice on the inside of the bedroom windows, there’s points where you’re like, ‘Urgh.’ But there’s points where you do need to just dig a little deeper. And just that kind of slight life-threatening adversity brings something else out of you as a human being. And we do use technology. We watch films, we’re chatting on Zoom now, we sit and play music, we do other things&nbsp;– it’s not as if we’re sitting here carving spoons all night with a candle on. But it is different from living in a city with technology surrounding you as a thing that you just turn to all the time.</p>



<p>You just naturally spend more time in awe of nature. You’ve got to get your wood to bring down for the burner and you’re looking at the view, or you see a red kite flying above you. You just feel a connection that you don’t get unless you’re living a bit closer to the land like this. And I think that moves also to having a spiritual connection, a feeling much more of belonging to where you are. I’ve bought a bit of land but I don’t really believe in landownership, but I did it because I didn’t want anyone to be able to take the housing that I have away from me and I wanted to be empowered by that. Also observing the Celtic calendar and all that –&nbsp;you’re in that tradition, you’re playing that music, you’re hearing that language, you’re hearing the wind and the rain and it’s all part of what enriches your life. We feel really lucky. Especially when COVID happened, we couldn’t be in a better place. We grow as much of our food as we can, we use an organic veg box, and I get most of the rest of my food from Highland Wholefoods. We rarely deal with supermarkets, we’ve removed ourselves a little bit from that.</p>



<p>Even the house; all the windows were bought second hand, as much as we can. We felled and milled all the wood on site here ourselves. Instead of going and buying the timber, you actually get your mates and chop the trees down and mill them yourself, and you just do that with everything. It’s just part of how you try and operate. And it saves you a lot of money now as well, because the prices are insane. We’ve got our wood out there for the rest of the build, and if we had to buy that now, we’d not be able to.</p>



<p>I do feel more centred as a human being – with my family on the land, doing what I’m doing – than I ever have in my life. And there’s lots of reasons for that, but I think it is that thing of thinking, ‘Right, I’m putting my roots down here and this is a long term thing.’ And it’s not, ‘Oh, then we can sell the house and move somewhere else and move up the ladder,’ and all that. This is for Oran, when I’m away this is Oran’s house, and hopefully his family’s place if that’s what he wants. Once we’ve moved on from the house being built, we’ll try and get a self-sustaining ecosystem here which is also inclusive for people to come and enjoy. I wouldn’t rule out us trying to get involved in helping people access this kind of thing in a more formal way once we have finished everything, because it’s important to me to not just be like, ‘We’re sorted now,’ and then sit back.</p>

<p><strong>L</strong><strong>D</strong><strong>: </strong><strong>What are your thoughts on sharing that learning about relationship and reciprocity that you mentioned with </strong><strong>folk that are living in cities who either are not going to have the opportunity to do it or maybe don’t want to? Many want to live in a city, or have to, but how people live in cities has to change drastically as well.</strong></p>



<p>B: It’s as simple as collective organisation&nbsp;–&nbsp;something like GAS [Glasgow Autonomous Space] being there now, or even the Kinning Park Complex and the way that operates.&nbsp;There’s lots of small scale things like that already happening, and they are all actually there, it’s just that you don’t hear about it. I think it will scale up, I don’t think it’s going to drop away suddenly. Going back to COP26 and the bigger picture of it, like Greta Thunberg is saying, the way capitalists are going to ‘fix’ climate change, capitalism and climate change are interlinked – the thing we keep coming up against is land and property ownership. I don’t mean just demonstrations, but just linking up as communities and creating these autonomous spaces as well, and then networks will just keep growing. Because people are realising that the people in power are not doing it and are not going to do it. Mutual aid basically, anarchism. Who are the people stepping up and getting things done at the refugee camps? It’s not the authorities. It’s mutual aid. It’s that spirit that underpins everything.</p>



<p>It needs more direct action activism, but what Talamh and the Pollok Free State really taught me is that you can’t spend all your energy going against what you don’t like as it leaves very little to create what you do like. I think that’s tipped over a bit now and loads of people are building what they do like, and seeing those networks, just small groups and collectives of people who are working together – that’s the only way I can kind of see this knowledge spreading out without getting greenwashed or co-opted.</p>



<p>I do worry that it’s too slow –&nbsp;because the power of what it’s up against in terms of resurgent fascism and climate change, and the way that the powers that be seem to be able to just manipulate the media narrative. My only way of staying sane against that is to actually just link up with people and go and do what you want to happen.</p>



<p>And whether that’s being at COP and having the demonstrations and all the rest of it, or creating a food garden in your local area and teaching people how to grow in an urban setting. And making sure places don’t get gentrified and developed, there’s green space, cycle routes, all these little victories. You can’t expect these powers that be to change because they rely so heavily on the profit motive, they don’t seem to understand that GDP shouldn’t be all we focus on. It’s starting to happen, but it needs to happen now.</p>



<p>Our society is fragile and vulnerable because we’ve been deskilled so much in that way, we just phone someone these days, you don’t do it yourself. Things like tool libraries and being able to actually share that expertise is key. I’m not being totally prepper about it, but industrial society is not going to be able to keep going the way it is, so you need a different set of skills to transition through that. And that includes the ability to be able to organise co-operatively and interact with each other that doesn’t involve hierarchies and coercion. And that’s such a valuable skill that we’re really going to need.</p>



<p>As a movement to become something bigger and stronger, it has to involve the people in the schemes as well. I remember there was a group called the Milton Class War Casuals and they were mad techno heads, but they looked like a bunch of mad neds that just went out clubbing, but they were switched on politically. If you had all the schemes like that, the power that is sitting in those communities if they were plugged into all these things as well. Resistance to capitalism and what’s happening with climate is pretty white and middle class and that’s something that really needs to change.</p>

<p>POEM</p>



<p><strong>COP out 26</strong></p>



<p>We are witnessing</p>



<p>death throes of dynastic dinosaurs</p>



<p>Oil and coal junkies</p>



<p>in a GDP suicide cult</p>



<p>Cognitive zombies</p>



<p>stumbling along a pathway</p>



<p>to planetary destruction</p>



<p>They see the flames licking</p>



<p>at the edge of their vision</p>



<p>as they wade through</p>



<p>floods of misinformation</p>



<p>Eyes stinging at rank hypocrisy</p>



<p>On an extractive treadmill</p>



<p>A vicious cycle</p>

<p>Fresh out of ideas</p>



<p>Unwilling, unable</p>

<p>Green new deal? = carbon copy</p>



<p>COP out 26</p>



<p>White men in suits</p>



<p>dancing a gruesome can can</p>



<p>Kicking the can, firmly out of sight</p>



<p>The fact is the most planning</p>



<p>they have done</p>



<p>is on how to contain our fury</p>



<p>The question is</p>



<p>Are they taking the rest of us down with them?</p>



<p>The answer is</p>



<p>Up to us.</p>
