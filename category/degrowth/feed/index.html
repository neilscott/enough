<p><strong>Enough! has joined with another 115 charities, economists, businesses, trade unions and academics to send an open letter to Scotland’s First Minister calling for an “urgent transition to a Wellbeing Economy.” Read the statement here: &#8216;<a href="https://www.weallscotland.org/_files/ugd/d7012c_5be16a45f7c9463cbdbae2717202c7a6.pdf?index=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redesigning our Economy for People and Planet: Joint Statement on the Wellbeing Economy (weallscotland.org)</a>&#8216; and the text of the letter below.</strong><br><br><strong>The Enough! Collective believes in the principles and values of a wellbeing economy and supports efforts of civil society to exercise pressure on our government. And we also believe that deeper change won&#8217;t, in fact can&#8217;t happen when we are still wedded to an economic system based on perpetual growth and rampant exploitation.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Redesigning our economy is essential as considerable suffering and loss, resulting from our current economic model, are already being keenly experienced across the globe. For Enough!, well-being for all is only possible if we break with growth.</strong><br><br>Dear First Minister<br><br>We are writing to you as a group of social and environmental justice NGOs, grassroots community groups, faith groups, service providers, funders, economists, academics, think tanks and business leaders united in our belief that Scotland must urgently transition to a Wellbeing Economy.<br><br>Many of us are firefighting to provide frontline support to those swept up in the rising tide of destitution.<br><br>Others among us are trying to play our part in the transition to an economy that values people and the environment, for example, piloting new ways of providing for each other, running community energy projects and deploying alternative business models that contribute to our communities.  Others are directly involved in efforts to restore nature and tackle poverty.<br><br>Too many people in Scotland are living in cold homes, skipping meals and falling behind on rent while Scotland&#8217;s 20 richest families own more wealth than 30 percent of the poorest citizens combined. In the most deprived 30% of Scottish areas life expectancy is falling. At the same time, there are growing fears that Scotland’s legal emissions reductions targets will be missed and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recently warned that the world faces a &#8220;brief and rapidly closing window to secure a liveable future.&#8221; The IPCC also echoed our collective belief that GDP is a poor metric of human<br>wellbeing.<br><br>As a founding member of the Wellbeing Economy Governments partnership, Scotland has played an important role in building momentum for change among governments. We were pleased to see the aspiration to become a Wellbeing Economy contained within Scotland&#8217;s National Strategy for Economic Transformation. We also welcomed the publication of the first iteration of the Wellbeing Economy monitor, efforts to encourage fair work, support for community wealth building and the commitment to review how to increase the number of purposeful and democratic businesses in Scotland. And we are looking forward to seeing the recommendations of the Business Purpose Commission and Just Transition Commission being taken forward. These are steps in the right direction.<br><br>But we are writing to you today because we are concerned that progress isn’t happening fast enough to meet the very real and urgent challenges we face. To date, we have not seen substantive progress in redesigning our economy which continues to break planetary limits and create high levels of inequality.<br><br>With its narrow focus on GDP growth, the National Strategy for Economic Transformation is grounded in the same logic that has delivered decades of poverty, inequality and environmental degradation. What is required now is a robust plan to put the wellbeing of people and nature at the heart of our economy.<br><br>Today we have published a joint statement on what we envision such a Wellbeing Economy to look like in Scotland, which will require actions from governments in both Westminster and Holyrood.<br><br>As next steps on the journey to a Wellbeing Economy we ask you and the Scottish Government to use the powers at your disposal to:<br><strong>Transform the National Performance Framework into a Wellbeing Framework and strengthen its power and reach.</strong><br><br>● In the short-term, this requires a comprehensive engagement process to underpin the review of the National Outcomes so the people of Scotland have a voice in shaping what the framework measures.<br><br>● In the medium term, ensure the upcoming Wellbeing and Sustainable Development Bill puts the wellbeing framework on a stronger statutory footing to provide a clear vision for public bodies, bringing together and strengthening a range of duties to put collective wellbeing and environmental sustainability at the centre of decision-making. This should include enhanced support and scrutiny mechanisms, for example through the promised Future Generations’ Commissioner. The Scottish Government should also bring forward a clear outcome budgeting framework, evidencing how public spending delivers wellbeing outcomes.<br><br><strong>Use devolved tax powers to share Scotland’s wealth more evenly and support public investment in a strong social safety net, universal basic services, fair public sector wages and environmental improvements needed for a Wellbeing Economy.</strong><br><br>● In the short-term, the next Budget should continue progressive moves to increase tax revenue more fairly and clearly set out both the distributional impacts of this and how revenue will be invested in areas that can help Scotland progress to a Wellbeing Economy.<br><br>● In the medium term, the Scottish Government should undertake wide-ranging public<br>engagement to develop options to realise a fully progressive tax system, including more<br>fundamental reforms to income tax rates and bands, a clear roadmap for reforming /replacing the regressive council tax, and options to utilise local tax powers.<br><br><strong>Reshape the business environment in Scotland to facilitate a shift towards purposeful and democratic business practices that support collective wellbeing and environmental sustainability and do not profit from undermining either of them.</strong><br><br>● In the short-term, enterprise agencies and all public business support should prioritise<br>purposeful and democratic business practices, including social enterprises, cooperatives and employee-owned enterprises, as recommended by the Business Purpose Commission. All projects to support entrepreneurship, innovation and start-ups delivered as a part of the<br>National Strategy for Economic transformation should be focused on those businesses that can make the biggest contribution to a Wellbeing Economy and should be tailored to different rural and urban contexts.<br><br>● In the medium-term, fair work conditions on public sector grants and contracts should be<br>strengthened and extended to other dimensions of a Wellbeing Economy, including<br>environmental aspects and democratic governance structures. Options should be developed for better incentivising purposeful business – for example, reforms to non-domestic rates and the introduction of environmental levies.<br><br>Scotland is full of hopeful and inspirational action that is putting the Wellbeing Economy thinking into practice. But transforming such actions into the economy we all need will require bolder action by the Scottish Government to set the direction of the economy, it requires a stronger infrastructure for participation in economic policy-making, ensuring that seldom heard voices are listened to, and it requires increased public investment into places, people and nature to deliver what really matters to people.<br><br>We hope that you will consider our asks and we would be keen to meet to discuss this further.<br><br>Signed by<br>Ailsa Raeburn, Chair, Community Land Scotland<br>Alan McClouskey, Chief Executive, Voluntary Sector Gateway West Lothian<br>Alfie Stirling, Chief Economist, New Economics Foundation<br>Amanda Burgauer, Executive Director, Common Weal<br>Professor Andrew Cumbers, Professor of Political Economy, Adam Smith Business School, University of<br>Glasgow<br>Professor Andrew Watterson, Emeritus Professor of Health, Stirling University<br>Angus Hardie, Director, Scottish Community Alliance<br>Annette Hastings, Professor of Urban Studies, University of Glasgow<br>B.D.

<p><em>Dr Katharina Richter on the cultural direction of socio ecological transformations. Illustrations by Deborah Mullen.</em></p>



<p>Degrowth is a big tent, peopled by ecological economists, political ecologists, activists, (eco)feminists, anthropologists, artists, researchers, students, political scientists, sociologists, and many more. Participants in a social movement, degrowthers are often both researchers and activists. They provide compelling answers to the question of how to live well and equitably within social and environmental limits. To address socially and ecologically harmful productivism and overconsumption, the initial focus lay on self-limitation, expressed in concepts such as ‘voluntary simplicity’ or ‘frugal abundance’. (1) Sustainable degrowth aims to democratically reduce consumption and production levels. (2) These notions are being pushed by post/decolonial thinkers, feminists, anti-racist activists, and environmental justice movements from the Global South, who complement this individualised, quantified approach to degrowth with a <em>pluriverse </em>of economic practices that centre care, communal resource governance, and diverse knowledges as conditions for the reproduction of life. (3)</p>



<p>We can see that changes to our consumption, production, and working patterns alone won’t be enough to sustain a profound transformation towards a just and sustainable world. To understand the deeper shifts that are required, we need to look at cultural aspects of socio-ecological transformations. So what would it mean to put a <em>cosmological </em>limit to growth? Namely, limits that arise from our cosmology – that is, the way we see the world, knowledge, our own destiny, the role of nature, and so on. (4) To help degrowth thought and practice grapple with this question, this article brings degrowth into conversation with <em>Buen Vivir</em>, an indigenous principle and decolonial practice of ‘Good Living’ from Latin America. The first part looks into perceptions that see degrowth as an anthropocentric – and thereby Eurocentric – movement. The second part introduces <em>Buen Vivir</em> and explains why a dialogue between the two helps overcome degrowth’s human-centred analysis. This section also sets out the importance of ‘cosmological limits to growth’ for cultural elements of sustainability transformations. The last part sketches out what ‘cosmological limits to growth’ can mean in practice. The ideas put forward in this article are based on my PhD, for which I conducted research in Ecuador. In early 2020, I interviewed 15 social leaders, community members, and politicians, and observed public meetings and municipal, nongovernmental, and indigenous assemblies.</p>



<p><strong>Degrowth’s Colonial Nature</strong></p>



<p>The political project, social movement, and field of study that is degrowth is a broad church. In it, you’ll find a broad range of knowledges and worldviews, contingent on the different disciplines’ methodologies and location within the natural and social sciences, humanities, or arts. There has been early criticism, however, of a tendency within degrowth to articulate a political critique of economic growth that is based on a narrow, anthropocentric view of the environment, and pays too little attention to colonial-era, hierarchical identity systems that continue to constrain equitable resource access. (5) This may be surprising, given degrowth’s core argument is that the economy is, in fact, embedded within a planetary ecosystem. The majority of early degrowth literature adopted this argument and worldview from the discipline of ecological economics, which seeks to dispel the strict nature/culture divide prevalent in our current understanding of the world, an inheritance of neoclassical economics. This divide is argued to be the underlying cause of ecological breakdown and ‘market failures’ such as pollution and waste (Fig.1). (6) However, the critique of growth put forward by ecological economics is based on the concept of ‘ecosystems’, from which, in a simplified manner, societies “receive inputs from the earth, the atmosphere, and the waters, and [to which] they give outputs”. (7)<br></p>

<p>The language of inputs and outputs, resources and materials acknowledges the embeddedness of human life within the natural environment. Yet, it also objectifies living beings, together with other abiotic elements like rocks and minerals. It detaches them from their cultural values, and the political processes that shape landscapes, societies, and histories. The nature/culture divide, for example, formed the cosmological basis of colonial plantation economies, which served as blueprints for industrial manufacturing in England and elsewhere. In plantations and later in factories, slaves and sugarcane then machine parts and workers were easily interchangeable as The language of inputs and outputs, resources and materials acknowledges the embeddedness of human life within the natural environment. Yet, it also objectifies living beings, together with other abiotic elements like rocks and minerals. It detaches them from their cultural values, and the political processes that shape landscapes, societies, and histories. The nature/culture divide, for example, formed the cosmological basis of colonial plantation economies, which served as blueprints for industrial manufacturing in England and elsewhere. (9) In plantations and later in factories, slaves and sugarcane then machine parts and workers were easily interchangeable as&nbsp; commodities – that is, exchangeable at market rates. (10) Early capitalist developments were also accompanied by scientific advances in astronomy, mining, or metallurgy. (11)  The place of humankind in the world was transformed, as were those remaining worldviews that saw nature as a living, female, nurturing being. Nature became an inanimate, controllable object. (12) This anthropocentric view sanctions resource exploitation and is arguably the cultural foundation of the economic growth paradigm.</p>



<p>By speaking of resources or materials, ecological economists, and some degrowthers, therefore accept and mirror the mapping of capitalist exchange values onto the intrinsic and disparate values of the living world. Degrowth scholarship influenced by ecological economics puts forward evidence for postgrowth transformations regarding work, money, or wellbeing in the form of economic models, which are based on the abstraction of ‘ecosystems’ into mathematical representation. (13) Though paramount for guiding policy, these models sustain a mechanistic view of nature. This is problematic – and Eurocentric – because in doing so these models risk universalising a provincial, European/North-Atlantic conceptualisation of nature – that is, nature-as-ecosystems, or even materials. This anthropocentrism in turn hampers possible alliances between degrowth and environmental justice movements from the Global South. In addition to degrowth’s anthropocentrism, some of these movements have rejected degrowth as an ally because of its labour-market based perception of time, perceived to clash with indigenous and cyclical notions of time. (14)</p>



<p>In response, a lot of work has been done by (activist-)scholars who aren’t ecological economists to show that this narrow cultural framing isn’t the only way of thinking, practicing, and approaching degrowth. In relation to degrowth, analyses of social property claims to trees in Brazil, the <em>khat </em>economy in Madagascar, <em>Ubuntu</em> in Southern Africa, <em>Buen Vivir</em> in Latin America, and environmental justice movements in Chiapas demonstrate that knowledge and ways of inhabiting the world are connected to territories as biophysical and political entities that are more than either ‘just’ nature, or ‘just’ culture. (15) Thereby, they show that it is possible to challenge anthropocentric, mechanistic conceptualisations of nature and attribute agency to the living world within the parameters of degrowth. These cultural analyses have undoubtedly broadened the tent of degrowth. Indeed, they show us how to overcome tendencies to reproduce anthropocentric nature/culture binaries within degrowth. <em>Buen Vivir </em>is one such approach to cultural analyses, and in a dialogue between degrowth and <em>Buen Vivir</em> has the potential to create an ecology of knowledges. (16) Such conversation brings together different ways of knowing so that together, they may overcome their respective limitations and confront the intersecting challenges of the Anthropocene.</p>

<p><strong><em>Buen Vivir</em> as a Grassroots, Decolonial Project</strong></p>



<p>Degrowth is one of the most convincing and holistic responses to the Anthropocene. However, its Eurocentric focus, expressed in, amongst others, forms of human-centric knowledge production, limits its place of relevance. It thereby also challenges only parts of the civilisationary patterns that have caused the multiple crises of the Anthropocene. Latin American thinkers have argued that we aren’t just living in times of ecological crisis, but in multiple crises of modernity, defined by racism, sexism, classism, anthropocentrism, etc. (17) So why would an equitable dialogue between degrowth and <em>Buen Vivir</em>, an Andean-Amazonian conceptualisation of ‘Good Living’, create useful frameworks for a decolonial approach to degrowth? First, the violent politics of extractivism that confront a good or in fact any life in the Andes, disclose what is at stake for people living on the extractive frontiers from which raw materials are obtained. Andean and Amazonian communities have everything to gain from degrowth in the North. Second, other ways of engaging with the natural, or living, world and with ‘others’ in our society show up the limitations of our own, dichotomous thinking when it comes to nature vs. culture, the insider-outsider logic of the nation state, etc. This process also requires us to recognise that scientific, peer-reviewed knowledge alone won’t be able to tackle the Anthropocene’s multiple crises. Third, it situates degrowth in relation to other responses to these intersecting crises. Connecting with decolonial struggles will allow us to design transformation strategies with tools and concepts that are fundamentally different than the ones that have led to these crises in the first place.</p>



<p>B<em>uen Vivir</em> is a grassroots, decolonial project of the Ecuadorian indigenous movements.<em> Buen Vivir</em>, or Good Living, is Spanish for the Kichwa terms of <em>sumak kawsay</em> or <em>alli kawsay</em>. <em>Sumak kawsay</em> is a concept that has its origins in the indigenous world. Though this is contested by some, we have textual evidence of its use as a pedagogical principle from the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. (18) It translates into ‘life in excellence’ or ‘life in plenitude’. Today, it has become an umbrella term for a broad range of practices, imageries, and ideals of marginalised and racialised communities for working towards establishing equilibria with oneself, one’s community, and nature. (19) The concept took on this broader meaning during the 1980s and 1990s, in which multiculturalism strengthened the indigenous movements. <em>Sumak kawsay </em>as a way of life configures close relations with land, within families and the spirits of ancestors, forests, water, and hills that are central to Kichwa identities, cultures, and thinking.</p>



<p>Politically, the concept was consolidated via interaction with development organisations and left-wing intellectuals during the 1990s and early 2000s, a process that culminated in the constitutionalisation of <em>sumak kawsay </em>as <em>Buen Vivir</em>, or the right to Good Living in the 2008 Ecuadorian constitution. (20) By granting rights to nature, the constitution challenges nature’s subordination to economic activity. However, this success was swiftly followed by a co-optation of the concept, which coincided with the loss of political power of the indigenous movements during the governments of Rafael Correa (2007–17). The political oppression of social, indigenous, and environmental movements took place under the guise of a discourse of <em>Buen Vivir</em> that justified extraction-led, growth-based development. (21) Nevertheless, today <em>sumak kawsay </em>continues to be a political platform for the indigenous movements of Ecuador towards territorial self-governance, equality, plurinationality, and wealth redistribution. (22)</p>



<p>But what does <em>sumak kawsay</em> mean in practice? The literature about this is sparse, so I went to Ecuador to find out. For the purpose of this article, I will zoom in on some of the world-making practices that I observed, in other words, patterns and behaviours that create ways of inhabiting and viewing the world in which human, natural, and spiritual wellbeing is connected. Amongst others, <em>sumak kawsay</em> can be found in the recovery of ancestral seeds, such as quinoa and amaranth, in agroecological farming practices, as well as in the rituals, traditions, and garments of the indigenous peoples of Ecuador. Some of those patterns and behaviours I observed took place while I sat talking over a fire with a community’s wisewoman. We rubbed our hands with an ointment made of plants and herbs that were grown using ancestral, agroecological farming practices. This simple act reminded us of our connection with nature. Another ritual I observed was the spilling of small amounts of alcoholic drinks, such as <em>chicha</em>, the typically fermented beverage made from maize or quinoa, on the ground before the drinker had any themselves. It is an offering to <em>Pachamama</em>, or Mother Earth, and recalls her presence. An act of reciprocity, it serves to sustain caring, affectionate, and mutualistic relationships between people and nature. Though the practitioners of these rituals were from agricultural communities, there is more than a utilitarian aspect to these rituals and agroecological farming practices. In Ecuador, agroecological production is not the norm, and can be met with considerable resistance from within or outside communities. Nevertheless, for practitioners like the Sumak Mikuna (“Excellent Food”) co-operative in El Tambo, located in the Southern Cañar province, the health of their children as well as topsoil fertility are dependent on the cultivation of a broad variety of high-quality organic produce. (23) Rather than neoclassical economic concerns such as profit margins, it is the underlying worldview, or cosmology, that animates these rituals, and which, vice versa, is put into practice by these rituals.</p>



<p>The experiences I came to know while in Ecuador made me think that the world-making practices of <em>sumak kawsay</em>, observed in various communities in Ecuador, articulate ‘<em>cosmological</em> limits to (development-as-)growth’. Though the communities where I’ve observed these practices don’t struggle against the same extent of unrestrained growth and over-consumption as communities in the Global North, there is an understanding of the need to limit ecologically and socially harmful practices, such as the application of chemical fertilisers, or the construction of luxury houses by migrant returnees from the US or Spain. The practices I described above have the potential to limit socioeconomic activities before harmful social or ecological effects occur. Their respect guarantees the well-being of nature, which, in turn, produces material and spiritual wellbeing in its people. (24) In these contexts, Pachamama doesn’t merely have a symbolic meaning. Instead, she is a living presence who can act as regulatory restraint to resource extraction and/or environmental degradation. ‘Cosmological limits to growth’ therefore refers to limits set by worldviews – and their accompanying practices – that embed humankind within the living world, rather than considering humans as the masters of a controllable, inert nature.</p>



<p>The argument I make here complements recent ‘limits’ debates within degrowth, ecological economics, and political ecology. They critically interrogate the mainstream environmental view of ‘limits’ as <em>external</em> – that is, physical and absolute borders, as epitomised in the famous, albeit depoliticised, image of ‘planetary boundaries’. It has been argued that, in and of itself, these limits, while having great potential to guide policy, do not contain unfettered growth. Given the lack of political progress in addressing the climate crisis, some highlight the possibility of prioritising morally constructed, <em>internal </em>limits that would restrain excess in autonomous societies<em>.</em> (25) Others have argued for <em>societal</em> self-limitation, where thresholds are defined collectively to contain both inequality and ecological destruction. (26)  Intersectional feminist and decolonial thinkers also stress the political nature or <em>artificiality </em>of scarcity that motivates some ‘limits’ scholarship and which justifies uneven resource access along gender, race, and class. (27)  They also draw attention to how different actors experience and understand limits and scarcity, and warn against a totalising conception of limits as ecological thresholds that erase other ways of relating to the living world – such as the practice of <em>sumak kawsay</em>. The notion of ‘cosmological limits to growth’ avoids the simplistic bifurcation of limits as either ‘real’ or ‘constructed’, and contains within it a possible pluriverse of worlds and knowledges without erasing one or the other. As such, ‘cosmological limits to growth’ are relational limits that arise out of our connection with each other and to the living world. They are normative constraints to the environmental destruction associated with economic growth. At the same time, they can create political instruments, such as Rights of Nature, that have the potential to change our view of nature as dead, inert matter, towards the environment as a living world. The conclusion will briefly elaborate on what impetus this notion can give to the cultural direction of socioecological transformations.</p>

<p><strong>Cosmological Limits to Growth in Action: On Cultural (and Political) Directions of Socio-ecological Transformations</strong></p>



<p>Politically, ‘cosmological limits to growth’ can be put into practice through Rights of Nature (RoN). Environmental personhood is becoming an increasingly popular policy instrument to safeguard against environmental exploitation. In the social sciences, it can challenge the nature/culture divide prevalent in many theoretical approaches. Rights-bearers now include rivers, mountains, and national parks in India, Ecuador, Colombia, New Zealand, the US, and elsewhere. Some have criticised RoN for perpetuating categorical binaries that pit a nature that is ‘out there’ against society, and for problematic colonial categories of personhood. (28) RoN nevertheless open up possibilities for protecting, and even imputing onto it, ways of living that respect nature as a living being. They could transform our understanding of nature from an inert resource towards a rights-bearer with agency. As such, RoN are an interesting, <em>pluriverse</em> avenue that should be explored in degrowth policy proposals.</p>



<p>In terms of cultural direction, there is a wider point to make for degrowth thinkers and practitioners. Going back to my observations in Ecuador, one agroecological producer planted certain types of trees to attract certain types of birds. In general, she dotted her vegetable patches with trees throughout, so that, in her words, the birds would have to eat as well. There might be another reason too: while the birds eat the fruits, they might fertilise a vegetable or two along the way. This is, in effect, the argument that agroecologists make: integrating natural solutions improves yield in comparison to monocrop production. In that sense, the grower’s relationship with nature doesn’t limit growth per se, but rather, the kind of culturally and ecologically harmful growth that a monocrop culture would bring. This observation, however, illustrates how ‘cosmological limits to growth’ embed society into nature. They recognise that while all ‘limits’ are necessarily socially constructed and physically present, it is this embeddedness that constrains harmful growth. ‘Cosmological limits to growth’ are intrinsic to worldviews based on connectedness with nature, and also found in pre-capitalist European cosmology. (29) They are antithetical to the nature/culture divide within some degrowth scholarship, which has been criticised as anthropo- and Euro-centric.</p>



<p>To really change the systems destroying the world, we need to fundamentally revisit our relationship with nature, and dismantle the nature/culture divide that justifies the treatment of the Earth as a resource. We need <em>cosmological</em> limits to growth because they steer the discussion beyond socioeconomic transformations to the more active, <em>cultural</em> direction of degrowth processes. To change the way we see nature, and, eventually, act towards it, is a fundamental condition for constraining harmful growth. If we consider ourselves part of nature and practice reciprocal behaviours, then we can eventually reinscribe cosmological limits to growth. However, changing the way we <em>think </em>and <em>feel</em> (“<em>sentipensar</em>”) requires a cultural transformation of a magnitude that has not yet been acknowledged by degrowth scholarship.</p>

<p><strong>An online collaborative learning programme with a residential learning retreat / field trip to Ullapool, run in partnership by the <a href="http://www.che.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Centre for Human Ecology</a> and Enough! Scotland.<br><br>The programme consists of&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>A weekly online session: <strong>Wednesdays 6.30pm &#8211; 8.30pm, <strong>Sept 14th &#8211; Nov 16th 2022</strong></strong></strong></li>



<li><strong>A residential learning retreat and field trip in the Ceilidh Place, Ullapool Oct 10th-14th.</strong></li>



<li><strong>Self-directed study: through a course handbook, online resources and a practice-based inquiry / study / creative exploration.&nbsp;</strong></li>



<li><strong>3 additional peer group meetings will be held over the period of the course (times to be agreed by each group)</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><strong><br>Description: </strong>An invitation to social and environmental practitioners, community workers and activists working in Scotland to collaboratively explore how the principles of degrowth and radical human ecology can inform and catalyse change. A 10-week programme, delivered as a partnership between Enough! Scotland and the Centre for Human Ecology, including a 4 night residential learning retreat and field trip at the Ceilidh Place in Ullapool in the Scottish Highlands.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>In times marked by an accelerating climate crisis, we explore together what degrowth could look like in Scotland, through a framing of human ecology and systems thinking. We understand ‘degrowth’ as meaning intergenerational social, ecological and migrant justice through decolonisation and equity within planetary limits – and this includes growth of socially and ecologically beneficial activity. The aim of this course is to create ripples to embed principles and practices of degrowth and human ecology among community and climate activists across Scotland. The course consists of a weekly online session with a talk followed by discussion, as well as readings for self-directed study. A key component of the course is to co-create a community of practice and peer-learning , which will be supported through a series of online peer group meetings and an in-depth 3.5-day (4 nights) residential in Ullapool. We draw upon methods taken from popular education and anti-oppression practices, peer-coaching and practical and immersive exercises.</p>



<p>The course takes place in the 50th anniversary year of the founding of the Centre for Human Ecology and the publication of Limits to Growth. We look forward to forming a learning community with you.</p>



<p><strong>Course format:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>8 online sessions:</strong> Each session will consist of a presentation on key themes in degrowth and human ecology, followed by a facilitated group discussion and break-out groups to digest the material.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Peer group meetings:</strong> There will be three additional online peer group meetings at times to be agreed by each group, and time dedicated to peer groups at the residential, in person.</p>



<p><strong>Contributors: </strong>Bronagh Gallagher, <a href="https://degrowth.org/lorenzo-velotti/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lorenzo Velotti</a>, Luke Devlin, <a href="http://www.mairimcfadyen.scot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr Mairi McFadyen</a>, <a href="https://www.rolandplayle.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roland Playle</a> and <a href="https://www.che.ac.uk/people/svenja-meyerricks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr Svenja Meyerricks</a>, with others to be announced</p>



<p><strong>Who is the course for? </strong>A key aim of the course is to develop the knowledge and capability of degrowth and human ecology principles among community and climate activists in Scotland. Participants are encouraged to either be normally resident in Scotland, or have another significant connection or interest.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>This is an outline of how we might situate degrowth in a history of alternative economics and regenerative movements, in the context of brutal new scientific and socio-economic realities.</em> <em>What does &#8216;true prosperity&#8217; look like in times of socio-ecological crisis?</em></p>



<p><strong>&#8220;Degrowth means primarily the abolition of economic growth as a social objective. This implies a new direction for society, one in which societies will use fewer natural resources and will organize and live differently from today. Ecological economists define degrowth as an equitable downscaling of production and consumption that will reduce societies’ throughput of energy and raw materials. However, the shift should not only entail a smaller <a href="http://www.ejolt.org/2012/11/social-metabolism-and-accounting-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social metabolism</a>, but more importantly a society with a metabolism that has a different structure and serves new functions.&#8221;</strong> &#8211; <em>Riccardo Mastini</em></p>



<p>Degrowth has emerged in recent years as a key idea to understand our time. But as the climate crisis accelerates and intensifies it has moved from being a significant idea to being an essential one. The problem for us is, as some have put it, &#8220;the challenges of realising a utopian necessity.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>DEGROWTH AND THE IPCC</strong></p>



<p>Degrowth is emergent as a set of ideas essential to understanding and responding to the climate and wider ecological crisis. In the latest IPCC report degrowth is discussed as an alternative sustainability concept with a specific take on well-being (chapter 1); in<em> Mitigation pathways compatible with long-term goals</em> (chapter 3), it is discussed as a scenario feature for modelling mitigation pathways; <em>as Demand, services and social aspects of mitigation</em>, it is evoked again in the context of prospective scenarios (chapter 5); and <em>as &#8216;Accelerating the transition in the context of sustainable development</em>&#8216; (chapter 17). (1)</p>



<p>We are, again, at a crossroads, but as the latest two IPCC reports confirm, this crossroads is an existential one. </p>



<p>In response, techno-modernists, capitalists and green socialists offer variations of more of the same. These broad three camps offer first: capitalism tempered by extraordinary and outlandish technologies (&#8216;negative emission technologies&#8217;); second, unfettered capitalism and third, productivism and giant-statism which also seem improbable. Versions of ‘Socialist Growth’ and ‘Luxury Communism’ are also part of these last scenarios. All offer variants of &#8216;business as usual&#8217; and all are based on forms of cycles of production and consumption. Production and consumption have resource implications regardless of whether they are state controlled or market led.</p>



<p>Now, science and ecology are converging on some hard truths, that a growth economy is incompatible with human habitation of our world.</p>



<p>In &#8216;Why degrowth is the only responsible way forward&#8217; Joël Foramitti, Marula Tsagkari and Christos Zografos write: <br><br>&#8220;The latest <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IPCC report</a> to limit global warming to 1.5° presents four scenarios. Three of them strongly depend on negative emission technologies, which are highly controversial as they have not been proven to work at the required scale and represent an “<a href="http://smartstones.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Kevin-Anderson-2016.10.13-the-Trouble-with-Negative-Emissions-Science-2016.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unjust and high-stakes gamble</a>”. The IPCC also provides a fourth scenario that does not rely on negative emissions, but which notably requires that “<a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59bc0e610abd04bd1e067ccc/t/5cb6db356e9a7f14e5322a62/1555487546989/Hickel+-+Degrowth%2C+A+Theory+of+Radical+Abundance.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global material production and consumption declines significantly</a>”.</p>



<p>But if degrowth is the key to responding to the climate catastrophe it is much wider and deeper than that. It is not a mechanistic solution to decarbonisation.</p>

<p>As Mastini points out (2), in Giorgos Kallis’ landmark book&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.agendapub.com/books/32/degrowth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Degrowth</a></em><a href="https://cup.columbia.edu/book/degrowth/9781911116806" target="_blank" rel="noopener">,</a> he makes three key arguments:</p>



<p>First, the&nbsp;global economy should slow down to avert the destruction of Earth’s life support systems, because a higher rate of production and consumption will run parallel to higher rates of damage to the environment.&nbsp;Hence,&nbsp;we should extract, produce and consume&nbsp;<em>less</em>, and we should do it all&nbsp;<em>differently</em>. Since growth-based economies collapse without growth we have to establish a radically different economic system and way of living in order to prosper in the future.</p>



<p>Second, economic growth is no longer desirable. An increasing share of GDP growth is devoted to&nbsp;‘defensive expenditure,’ meaning the costs people face as a result of environmental externalities such as pollution. Hence, growth (at least in rich countries)&nbsp;has become “un-economic:” its benefits no longer exceed its costs.</p>



<p>Third, and this is key, growth is always based on exploitation, because it is driven by investment that, in turn, depends on surplus. If capitalists or governments paid for the real value of work then they would have no surplus and there would be no growth. Hence, growth cannot reduce inequalities; it merely postpones confronting exploitation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The state of late-capitalist society is so dysfunctional that systems are collapsing and turning in on themselves. This is most peoples lived-reality not the subject for environmental academics. Finally the connection between &#8216;growth&#8217; and exploitation and the colonial mindset is clear. Growth is imperial. Climate crisis is manifest destiny. The criticism of &#8216;green austerity&#8217; doesn&#8217;t recognise this reality and fails to comprehend an approach which brings radical abundance. </p>



<p><strong>EXITING THE ECONOMY</strong></p>



<p>If degrowth grew out of the poverty and emptiness of &#8220;sustainable development&#8221; we can see it here as part of a wider movement of alternative economics and regenerative movements that have emerged since the 1970s. This article aims to situate degrowth in those sister movements and argues that degrowth is the emergent set of radical ideas around which the climate movement and the convergence of radical green and progressive forces (the &#8216;movement of movement&#8217;s) should coalesce.</p>



<p>Degrowth emerged in the late 1970s and was first used by André Gorz. In his book Ecology and Freedom, published in 1977. Gorz was influenced by Jean-Paul Sartre and his philosophy is infused by Existentialism throughout his work.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="474" height="836" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/th.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9752" srcset="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/th.jpg 474w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/th-170x300.jpg 170w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/th-100x176.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px" /></figure>



<p>Gorz doesn’t want to just &#8216;save the planet&#8217;, through his ecology, he defends a wider and deeper vision of humanity, freed from capitalism and the industrial (and post-industrial) society. His &#8216;defence of nature&#8217; requires a better understanding of our own lives, of our actions and values the fundamentals of our society. It is closely allied to Herbert Marcuse&#8217;s critique in One Dimensional Man (1964).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="602" height="955" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/18168760611.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9751" srcset="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/18168760611.jpg 602w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/18168760611-189x300.jpg 189w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/18168760611-585x928.jpg 585w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/18168760611-100x159.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></figure>



<p>André Gorz&#8217;s work is also closely allied to the philosophy of Ivan Illich. In fact Gorz published one of Illich&#8217;s speeches in <em>Les Temps Modernes</em> in 1961 and met him in 1971 in <em>Le Nouvel Observateur</em> at the publishing of <em>Deschooling Society</em> (<em>Une Société sans école</em>). </p>



<p>Gorz would later published a summary of Illich&#8217;s <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tools_for_Conviviality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tools for Conviviality</a></em> (1973) under the title <em>Libérer l&#8217;avenir</em> (Free Future). Illich&#8217;s ideas about &#8216;conviviality&#8217; find new expression and new meaning in degrowth strategies. As we write in <a href="https://www.enough.scot/degrowthhandbook/">Degrowth in Scotland</a> (Conviviality and the Commons): &#8220;The practice &#8216;commoning&#8217; can be understood as the lived experience of conviviality: the &#8216;art of &#8216;living together&#8217; (con-vivere). It involves finding those cultural practices &#8211; those that exist in present, those that have always been there (and are now only being rediscovered) and those that are being created now, for the future &#8211; which restore life and community.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="730" height="1024" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/562_Degowth_Course_Booklet_PRINT-1-730x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9766" srcset="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/562_Degowth_Course_Booklet_PRINT-1-730x1024.jpg 730w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/562_Degowth_Course_Booklet_PRINT-1-214x300.jpg 214w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/562_Degowth_Course_Booklet_PRINT-1-768x1077.jpg 768w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/562_Degowth_Course_Booklet_PRINT-1-585x820.jpg 585w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/562_Degowth_Course_Booklet_PRINT-1-100x140.jpg 100w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/562_Degowth_Course_Booklet_PRINT-1.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" /></figure>



<p>The point in emphasising degrowth&#8217;s origin story &#8211; via Gorz and Illich &#8211; is to recognise that it&#8217;s not just about the economy and it&#8217;s not just about climate and carbon. Degrowth pre-dates the climate crisis. Degrowth calls for the reconceptualisation of life. This was true before the climate crisis.</p>



<p>&#8220;‘Degrowth’ (‘décroissance’) has come to signify &#8220;the desired direction of societies that will use fewer natural resources and will organize themselves to live radically differently. ‘Simplicity’, ‘conviviality’, ‘autonomy’, ‘care’, ‘commons’ and ‘dépense’ are some of the words that express what a degrowth society might look like.&#8221; (3)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="670" height="1024" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/78-670x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9753" srcset="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/78-670x1024.jpg 670w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/78-196x300.jpg 196w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/78-768x1174.jpg 768w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/78-1005x1536.jpg 1005w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/78-585x894.jpg 585w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/78-1170x1789.jpg 1170w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/78-100x153.jpg 100w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/78.jpg 1308w" sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" /></figure>



<p><strong>DECOLONISATION AND DEGROWTH</strong></p>



<p>If degrowth means a new way of living it also has profound implications for relations between people in different parts of the world &#8211; the &#8216;developed&#8217; and the &#8216;undeveloped.&#8217;</p>



<p>If it means as Ben See has put it a shift from the “imperial mode of living”: in which &#8220;a minority of rich people undermining the basic conditions of existence for everyone else, starting with the most vulnerable&#8221; &#8211; it also means &#8216;decolonisation&#8217; which is a contemporary not a historic condition. It is not about tokenistic campus or museum changes in representation it is about stopping the endless and brutal colonisation that is a characteristic of capital.</p>



<p>This idea of permanently extracting energy from people and places, plundering communities and regions is an essential part of our growth-thinking, or certainly the thinking imposed on us. But now colonisation is coming home.</p>



<p>The extractivist economy does not just destroy nature and plunder natural resources, this process is part of the imperial mindset. Ecological destruction and colonisation are intertwined, they are inexorably connected.  But now we are playing catch-up with the stories we are told.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.hachette.co.uk/titles/kojo-koram/uncommon-wealth/9781529338652/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Uncommon Wealth, Britain and the Aftermath of Empire</a>&nbsp;by Kojo Koram the author explores the dynamic between the world of former colonies and Britain. He describes a “boomerang effect” by which what Britain did to its colonies, it is now doing to itself.</p>



<p>Reviewing Koram’s book Eric Rauchway writes (‘<a href="https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/butler-to-the-world-oliver-bullough-american-kleptocracy-casey-michel-uncommon-wealth-kojo-koram-book-review-eric-rauchway/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pirates of the Metropolis’</a>): </p>



<p>“In his elegantly constructed book, Koram is principally concerned to establish that economic development does not work as we were promised. It used to be common to claim that, with time, former colonial possessions would follow a path to modernity and move beyond gross inequality, internal strife and burdensome debt to resemble the prosperous and stable societies of their erstwhile imperial masters. Instead, he notes, history has moved in the other direction, with Britain becoming ever more like the nations of the global South. Moreover, this result has come not from incident but from concerted and intentional action; the undermining of sovereignty is not merely something the colonizers have done to the colonized, but rather what great private wealth has done to all nations, working its way from the periphery to the centre. “Innovations that are implemented for capitalist accumulation in the ‘Third World’, don’t tend to stay there”, Koram writes. The empire used to justify itself with the story that it was helping the colonies to become like the metropolis. Instead, Koram observes, the metropolis has become ever more like the colonies.”</p>



<p><strong>BRINGING IT BACK HOME</strong></p>



<p>If the &#8220;imperial mode of living&#8221; is contrasted with the degrowth alternative, empire, conquest and colonisation are replaced with reinhabitation, nurture and place-knowledge.  <br>In this sense <strong>&#8216;</strong>decolonisation&#8217; and &#8216;reinhabitation&#8217; are twins, key elements that combine to reverse hundreds of years of violent misrule.</p>



<p>In a Scottish context these ideas might draw on traditions of &#8216;thrift&#8217; and frugality and from gaelic traditions of <em>Dùthchas</em> &#8211; a notion of a sense of place and belonging &#8211; as well as our (mislaid) history of ideas around regionalism and bioregionalism.   </p>



<p>Learning to &#8216;live in place&#8217; will become a practical necessity as re-localisation and living within the natural carrying capacity of our bioregions becomes normal as climate breakdown intensifies.</p>



<p>The era in which &#8216;climate breakdown&#8217; is something in the future is long past, and now the very social conditions in western societies are in plain and brutal view.</p>



<p>The prefiguration of this process which has culminated in degrowth can be seen with the waves of regenerative movements and the rise of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDtDoiITi0g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;doomer optimism&#8221;</a>, the intertwined movements of: meta-modernism; neo-localism; decentralisation; bioregionalism and cosmo-localism.</p>



<p>If such movements lacked a radical edge and routinely faltered into forms of bourgeois lifestyle-ism they can be seen as useful skills&#8217; workshops, and consciousness-raising.</p>



<p>If degrowth can be seen as the latest in a line of alternative economic ideas, projects and schemes then the constellation of alternative economics that pre-date and surround degrowth can also be seen as part of a wider momentum. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="640" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FI1yj0eXIAshSk9-1024x640.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9750" srcset="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FI1yj0eXIAshSk9-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FI1yj0eXIAshSk9-300x188.jpg 300w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FI1yj0eXIAshSk9-768x480.jpg 768w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FI1yj0eXIAshSk9-585x366.jpg 585w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FI1yj0eXIAshSk9-1170x731.jpg 1170w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FI1yj0eXIAshSk9-100x63.jpg 100w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FI1yj0eXIAshSk9.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>If some of these are books rather than social movements, and many of them have been subject to corporate capture or assimilation, they can still function as precursors to a wider degrowth moment.  Parecon held/holds a useful debate about a transition away from representative democracy. Wellbeing and circular economics are useful details about our necessary direction, even if they are partial and liberal ideas.</p>



<p>Other tools and alternative economic ideals come from outwith Europe:</p>



<p>&#8220;Degrowth alternatives may involve indigenous ways of organising social life and livelihoods according to the good of the community, for example though Buen Vivir (&#8216;the good life&#8217;), a concept emerging from Ecuador, the inclusive community planning toolkit Plan de Vida (Life Plan) of the Columbian Misak people &#8230; it might take the shape of feminist, anti-corporate activism, such as Vandana Shiva&#8217;s farming and seed saving project Navdanya in Uttarakhand, North India.&#8221; (4)</p>



<p>If degrowth builds on the collective wisdom of Social Ecology, Eco Feminism (5) and forty years of cumulative ecological movement-building, all point to the trajectory outlined by Jason Hickel in saying:</p>



<p>&#8220;The &#8220;economy&#8221; is our material relationship with each other and with the rest of the living world. We have to decide whether we want that relationship to be based on extraction and exploitation, or on reciprocity and care.&#8221;</p>

</figure>



<p>Now, as system-failure accelerates and the social economy collapses, degrowth is becoming the emergent principle from which many of these movements and moments can be seen as stepping-stones of understanding. </p>



<p><strong>UNPOPULAR TRUTHS</strong></p>



<p>Some of these ideas and projects have been assimilated and captured, others were too benign for their own good. For example, it is impossible to find someone who is against &#8216;wellbeing&#8217;, and as such it has no political capital.</p>



<p>Degrowth&#8217;s strength lies in it being an extremely unpalatable concept.</p>



<p>The fact that it generates such a visceral reaction is a good sign.</p>



<p>In 2022 the growth economy, and its inevitable consequences are laid waste and exposed. It is not for the degrowth movement to defend.</p>



<p>The onus is on proponents of the growth world we live in to defend it.</p>



<p>This is all very basic, but for those clinging on to the notion of growth as a dispenser of wealth or a system from which all flourish the facts say otherwise: </p>



<p>&#8220;In 2021, the bottom half of the world population owns less than <a href="https://wir2022.wid.world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2%</a> of global wealth. Compare this to the richest decile (around half a billion people) that owns 76%, or even to the top centile (only 51 million people) that claims 36% of all existing wealth. With their crumb of world wealth, the poorest half of humanity causes only <a href="https://wid.world/document/climate-change-the-global-inequality-of-carbon-emissions-1990-2020-world-inequality-lab-working-paper-2021-21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12%</a> of global greenhouse gas emissions while the richest 10% generate almost half of all emissions. Let that sink in: the top 1% richest individuals (16.8% of global emissions) emit more than the 2.5 billion poorest individuals.&#8221; (6)</p>



<p>An obvious criticism is that much of this is contained within the academic, and within the European sphere and is dominated by a discourse of white men. This all true but the point being laboured is that degrowth emanates from a deeper liberatory tap-root from the movements of radical liberation from the 1960s and 70s.</p>



<p><strong>DEGROWTH AS SOLIDARITY</strong></p>



<p>If decolonisation and reinhabitation offer a conceptual alternative to empire and globlisation, they need to be manifest in reality and in lived experience. They need to be present in everyday life and be visible as tangible assets in the coming struggles.</p>



<p>For this to make sense degrowth needs to become a social movement of change not a set of ideas. This will require a political debate with the wider left which still talks of &#8216;green austerity&#8217; but much more importantly it will require a grassroots community-based movement to build networked-communities experiencing radical abundance as an alternative.</p>



<p>Enough! have started this process in collaboration with other tentative forces and networks.<br><br>This is primarily and firstly about networks of social solidarity in a society characterised by toxic views of class and culture and in a rapidly disintegrating economic context and in which populist and far-right wing visions proliferate. Beyond this deformed versions of libertarianism prosper and this is a challenge for truly liberatory political projects.</p>

<p>Degrowth must also &#8216;land&#8217; in a society in which &#8220;Don&#8217;t Look Up&#8221; is a reality, in which people are either too preoccupied by the stresses of daily survival or in which &#8220;reflexive impotence&#8221; or &#8220;mandatory individualism&#8221; are traits and scars of survival.</p>



<p>How is any of this possible?</p>



<p>One answer is that the climate reality is leaking in to everyday life, from resource wars to flash flooding to extreme weather events to the refugee crisis. This reality can&#8217;t be ignored any longer. The second is that we have just lived through a (cliche klaxon &#8216;unprecedented&#8217;) collective experience that we are still unable to process in which the tendrils of state control and &#8216;benevolence&#8217; have been stretched and questioned.</p>



<p>If the pandemic showed the fragility of things it also showed remarkable social resilience and solidarity. Now the war in Ukraine exposes again the ridiculous precariousness of a society based on externalities. Food and energy are outsourced and uncontrolled. We live in a world which is literally out of control and from our (relative) comfortable western lives we have assumed these benefits are safe and secure.</p>



<p>If the failure of the of the British state and the descent of living standards have become acute this is not likely to propel any change on its own.</p>



<p>The challenge for proponents of degrowth is to make manifest &#8216;radical abundance&#8217; in a society experiencing extremes of poverty and deprivation. That is a political and a conceptual challenge, and one that takes place in a putative semi-state, in a landscape dominated by constitutional issues which tend to obscure all others.</p>



<p>Creating degrowth cultures and changing the narrative about how &#8216;wealth&#8217; is created and what a &#8216;true prosperity&#8217; would look like is the challenge ahead. This is a major challenge in a society deep in climate denial and suffering post-covid PTSD. But is it a challenge that comes in the wake of seismic climate failure and the UK emerging as a sort of failed state, a kleptocracy of elite rule. &#8216;True prosperity&#8217; may seem an elusive and difficult aim but in the context of immiseration and climate failure the status quo is indefensible.</p>

<p><em><strong>Vishwam Heckert explores how we move beyond empire and imperialism, abstraction and disconnection: “&#8230;if we wish to transform our world, we cannot do so without unlearning the embodied and psychic habit of separating ‘us’ and ‘them’ or ‘me’ from the ‘world’.”</strong></em></p>



<p>You do not have to be good.<br>You do not have to walk on your knees<br>for a hundred miles through the desert repenting.<br>You only have to let the soft animal of your body<br>love what it loves.</p>



<p>– Mary Oliver, Wild Geese</p>



<p>Sitting in the garden here in Cupar, drinking in this late September warmth, a familiar sound draws my gaze to the flight path above – not of aeroplanes, but wild geese wending their way south for winter. I love their dynamically shifting V-formations, supporting each other in their long journey home. The way they listen to the wind with their wings, following the flow that guides them on their way, makes my heart sing.</p>



<p>I’m also inspired to remember that the ancient ancestors of these beautiful geese also faced extinction. Rather than disappearing as we once thought, we now know that some of the dinosaurs found their wings. They adapted to changing conditions, discovering hidden depths of capacity within themselves.</p>



<p>In these times, there is little doubt that once again the Earth is calling on us all to evolve – to find new forms for living together. And we can see this isn’t easy. Change seems to bring fear and resistance. That is to be expected.</p>



<p>The secret of flight seems to lie in becoming empty. Even the bones of birds are hollow, giving them lift.</p>



<p>~~~</p>



<p>We might see ourselves as children of empire, either rebelling against or obedient to (two sides of the same coin) a <em>belief</em> that a particular way of living is advanced, superior, and unquestionably right. We might see how this pattern becomes embodied in our movements, our emotional responses, and our ways of thinking. And yet, somehow its grasp is never complete.</p>



<p>For before, during, and after empire, here is the Earth. We are first and foremost of the Earth and anything we have learned from empire, we can unlearn. Not simply with our intellect but with our whole being. In unlearning, we allow ourselves to evolve. Not by force, not by strategy, not by grandeur, but through gentleness, simplicity, and community.</p>



<p>This transformation of our culture is so critical, it can’t be rushed. Instead, we might honour the value and power of gentleness, of slowing down and of allowing ourselves to be transformed from within by the power of life itself. This inner transformation seems to be essential to the outer cultural shift we are all desperately hoping for.</p>



<p>The wing muscles of the wild geese are strong, it’s true. But it’s the sensitivity of the feathers that lets them follow the wind. It’s the humility of their hearts that allows them to take turns leading. No one is in front in order to impress the others, but to support them just as that one has been supported by the others.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="716" height="1024" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1024-1464-716x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9585" srcset="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1024-1464-716x1024.jpg 716w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1024-1464-210x300.jpg 210w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1024-1464-768x1098.jpg 768w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1024-1464-585x836.jpg 585w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1024-1464-100x143.jpg 100w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1024-1464.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 716px) 100vw, 716px" /></figure>



<p>Disconnection is both the root and the fruit of empire. There can be no hierarchy without separation, no ‘other’ to conquer and control. For anyone to draw lines on a map or between kinds of people, effectively declaring some lives are more important than others relies on the <em>imagination</em> that Life is fragmented, that the Earth is not a singular being. Of course, we each have our own wonderful and distinctive way of being in the world. Life is beautifully diverse. And it is all deeply connected.</p>



<p>When viewed through the lens of empire, life seems to be distorted. Even the teachings of the nice young man 2,000 years ago who said simply “love each other” somehow became justification for Crusades and sectarian violence when translated through the world-view of the Roman Empire. If we wish to transform our world, we cannot do so without unlearning the embodied and psychic habit of separating ‘us’ and ‘them’ or ‘me’ from the ‘world’.</p>



<p>We might now choose to replace the word empire with trauma and see how it still makes sense. Empire seems abstract, maybe distant. Trauma is intimate and embodied. But the patterns are the same. Empire is both cause and result of intergenerational trauma. My Oglala Lakota relative Edwina Brown Bull of Pine Ridge Reservation speaks powerfully of this when she talks of the history of boarding schools for indigenous people as part of the genocidal policies of the US (and Canadian) governments which we are hearing about now in the news.</p>



<p>“It’s important to understand that Federal Indian Policy played a major role in not only dismantling who we were as a people, but the land and the boarding schools were all a part of the Federal Indian Policy that were an attempt to assimilate the indigenous people to be … [weighted pause] emotion just struck me … it was an attempt for us to be something that they wanted us to be. […] As I’m learning more about the Federal Indian Policy and the impact it had on everything – every part of our indigenous nations – the one thing I have to remind myself is that <em>they can only do to us what was already done to them</em>. So when I say that statement, I’m looking at it not from a victim standpoint but more from a place of seeing that there was trauma within them in order for those to acts to happen to us. [There was trauma at] all levels from governmental to personal – all those levels!”</p>



<p>I love her deep sense of compassion, of recognising the suffering of those she might be tempted to call an enemy. But she does not. She sees only human beings, being human. And she knows that compassion is key to all healing, all beneficial change. Including, perhaps especially, compassion for ourselves. Notice how she saw that emotion struck her while she spoke and how she embraced it with compassion before continuing. Decolonisation, we might say, is a profound process of recovery from trauma and a re-opening to the fullness, wholeness, and beauty of life.</p>



<p>A parallel trauma still exists within the elite of Scottish (and British) society where young children are separated from families and sent to boarding school. Here they are not encouraged to be who they are … but to be something that others want them to be. For empire to continue, domination must be taught. And for it to end, it must be unlearned – not just intellectually, but in our whole being. Having worked both collaboratively and therapeutically with individuals sent to such schools, I can say the effect of the trauma is palpable. And yet, there is also great beauty and resilience. I have learned so much from boarding school survivors in Scotland and among the Lakota.</p>



<p>Edwina’s insights also tie in with recent scientific research which shows the biochemical signs of trauma exist equally within those we might call perpetrators and those we might call victims. Everyone is tangled up together in the same mess and we can only come untangled together. This is not to disregard the benefits of privilege by any means, but rather to recognise that material and social privilege is not the same as emotional wellbeing and a healthy sense of place in the world.</p>



<p>We all handle trauma differently. Many of us learn to survive by thinking to ourselves “it wasn’t that bad” and focussing our attention on what we might think of as “bigger problems”. Others get very caught up in the trauma, holding it close and making it an identity. We might say we have nothing to lose but our chains, but what if our chains are how we make sense of the world?</p>



<p>When we look closely at these big questions – like decolonisation, degrowth, and decarbonisation (i.e. transforming the foundation of our whole way of life), we might see that they are made up of a whole lot of smaller questions about our every day lives. It’s not logical to say we can have a healthy, sustainable, and equitable culture in Scotland without nurturing the conditions which allow the healing of the traumas that keep us feeling disconnected in various ways. That would be a bit like trying to help an ecosystem recover without tenderly nurturing the plants and animals&#8230;</p>



<p>~~~</p>



<p>Many of the great spiritual traditions teach that to heal the wounds we carry with us and to be of greater service to humanity and our whole planet, we might choose the path of becoming empty, like wild geese. In the Oglala Lakota tradition, we see very clearly how this supports a non-capitalist way of life:</p>



<p>We are called to become hollow bones for our people and anyone else we can help, and we are not supposed to seek power for our personal use and honor. What we bones really become is the pipeline that connects Wakan-Tanka, the Helpers and the community together. This tells us the direction our curing and healing work must follow and establishes the kind of life we must lead. It also keeps us working at things that do not bring us much income. So we have to be strong and committed to stick with this, otherwise we will get very little spiritual power, and we will probably give up the curing and healing work.</p>



<p>Frank Fools Crow, Oglala Lakota Holy Man</p>



<p><br>&nbsp;Here Fools Crow describes a radical openness to life and to Spirit – to listening to what is guiding us to serve others rather than become focussed on our selves.</p>



<p>In the Christian tradition, becoming ‘hollow bones’ is called kenosis (self-emptying). Rather than seeing Jesus as an authority to be obeyed (Roman Empire translation), we might see him as a great wisdom teacher who demonstrated a mystical path of becoming empty much as Lakota, Buddhist, Yoga, and other traditions teach. When we see the word mystical, we might think it’s something airy-fairy, but this work is profoundly practical for healing the patterns of empire/trauma within and around us. Cynthia Bourgeault describes a simple three-step process inspired by his teachings sometimes called ‘The Welcoming Prayer’. First we simply observe any sensation in our body which is tight, or holding, in any way. Common areas include bottom, belly, shoulders, and jaw. Maybe you notice some areas holding now? Perhaps our usual way of operating is to try to banish anything we don’t like from our experience or just grit our teeth and bear it. This practice offers another way. Instead, we start by simply “<em>acknowledging</em> what is going on internally during a distressing physical or emotional situation, ‘<em>welcoming</em>’ it, and <em>letting it go” </em>(p172, original emphasis)<em>. </em>In other words, letting the soft animal of your body relax and embrace being present in this living moment.</p>



<p>My teacher’s teacher in Yoga, Swami Satchidananda, also advocated a kind of kenosis which he called Undoism.</p>



<p>People often ask me, “What religion are you? You talk about the Bible, Koran, Torah. Are you a Hindu?” I say, “I am not a Catholic, a Buddhist, or a Hindu, but an Undo. My religion is Undoism. We have done enough damage. We have to stop doing any more and simply undo the damage we have already done.</p>



<p>Unlearning empire, unlearning separation, unlearning identifying with categories that keep us apart … undoing the damage we have done and recognising ourselves as integral with Nature, with Life Itself. Through the practices of Yoga (including breathing, meditation, postures, awareness of the mental patterns, community and devotion to something which is greater than ourselves) or similar paths of healing and transformation, we find our sense of separation becoming thinner as we come undone.</p>



<p>In undoing or emptying, we discover a fullness, a great beauty and sense of wonderment, much as ‘degrowth’ invites us to grow in ways that aren’t just about money but are about the wholeness of life. Until we empty ourselves of our need for more, we’ll never discover the richness that we already are. Capitalism depends very much on the suppression of our connection with life, with our bodies, with our pain, and with our healing. We’re invited, instead, to distract ourselves endlessly with either working or consuming. Simply being, breathing, enjoying what life brings to us and those around us, gently undermines the structures of empire/trauma that hold us frozen in a pattern that can only lead to collapse. Instead of that road, we might instead choose the radical self-care that enables us to remember that our place here on Earth is valuable, our unique contributions needed, and our healing that is the foundation of all of that.</p>



<p>Through emptying, we find our inner world becoming quieter and more peaceful. It is only when we are quiet inside that we might really <em>listen</em>. We can listen to each other in a way that allows for real community, real healing, real transformation. We can listen to that quiet inner voice of intuitive conscience that guides us to the most helpful words and deeds. We might even find we can listen to the earth, to the trees, to other beings in ways our culture tells us is impossible. For indigenous cultures, however, it is perfectly natural to listen to the trees.</p>



<p>I too was a stranger at first in this dark dripping forest perched at the edge of the sea, but I sought out an elder, my Sitka Spruce grandmother with a lap wide enough for many grandchildren. I introduced myself, told her my name and why I had come. I offered her tobacco from my pouch and asked if I might visit in her community for a time. She asked me to sit down, and there was a place right between her roots.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, modern science is only just beginning to see how much the trees speak to each other. As we all evolved together, made of the same stuff, is it so hard to imagine that we might also listen to the trees and they to us? If we wish to develop a sustainable way of life, listening to the teachings of indigenous people (including the folk wisdom and old tales of our own indigenous ancestors here in Scotland) and finding our own direct connection with the land around us is invaluable.</p>



<p>~~~</p>



<p>Through individual and collective practices of healing, our relationships are transformed: with ourselves, each other, the land, and whatever word we might like to use for the Infinite. The great anarchist Gustav Landauer pointed to this as the essence of revolution, for no institution is a transcendental being, above and beyond every day life. “The state”, he wrote, “is a social relationship; a certain way of people relating to one another. It can be destroyed by creating new social relationships; i.e., by people relating to one another differently.” Following indigenous teachings and great eco-mystics like Mary Oliver, Kathleen Jamie, Nan Shepard, and John Muir, we might expand this to include our relationships with trees and mountains, with earthworms and songbirds, with healing herbs and clear running waters.</p>



<p>We might look to the inspiring radical herbal health project known as Grass Roots Remedies. They are a workers’ cooperative, inspired by Permaculture principles, who are organically growing, harvesting, preparing, and distributing herbal medicine through public outreach projects, online sales, shops, and at their low-cost herbal clinics in Wester Hailes and Granton. The team focus on plants that grow wild in Scotland, rather than importing herbs which may be endangered by over-harvesting, and teach self-care through earth connection, just as indigenous cultures (including in Scotland) have always done.</p>



<p>We are also blessed in Scotland to host a number of forest gardens, which demonstrate a very different relationship with land than we see in most domesticated home gardens or in industrial agriculture. Some are inspired by permaculture principals – including Graham Bell and Nancy Woodhead’s ‘Garden Cottage’ in Coldream, Euan Sutherland’s ‘Rowan Refuge’ in Glasgow, or Alan Carter’s forest garden allotment in Aberdeen. Meanwhile, Rosa Steppanova and James MacKenzie’s ‘impossible garden’ in Shetland is inspired by her memories of growing up in the Black Forest and their shared passion for wildlife, beauty, and ecological diversity. Back in the Borders, Bird Gardens Scotland is reforesting and hosting programmes for conservation breeding of rare species of wild and domesticated birds. These gardens produce tremendous yields not only in terms of foodstuffs (Graham and Nancy regularly harvest 1.25 tons of food in a year on a fifth of an acre) but in space for wildlife to thrive and for human visitors to be inspired by what is possible with care, planning, and a love of nature.</p>



<p>If we wish to continue the thread of this essay in taking inspiration from indigenous cultures, we might look also to the Landback movement in North America and elsewhere to return land to indigenous stewardship and collective liberation. While the Scottish government’s support for community buyouts is laudable, we might like to set our sights on deeper transformation as we collectively consider the opportunities provided by Scottish independence. We might ask, what could Landback look like here?</p>



<p>Maybe we don’t need to know what the future holds, but simply to focus on deepening our connection with the Earth, with Life, and supporting each other to find our wings. Let’s see how we fly!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Hello world. Welcome to Glasgow. Welcome to Scotland. We are drawing on Glasgow’s radical past to inject hope and urgency into the moribund COP process.</strong><br><br>YOUR VISION OF our country may be an idealised one of lochs brimming with salmon and glens filled with deer, but in reality we’re a petro-chemical economy being held ransom by the British State. Our most famous icons and exports – our salmon and deer and grouse – are really symbols of a country disfigured by landed power. We remain a semi-feudal nation with one of the most unequal distributions of land ownership in the world. </p>



<p>In Gaelic, Glasgow means ‘Dear Green Place’, but Glasgow was also known from the 19th century as the Second City of the Empire, a city that became synonymous with massive expansion, global trade, industry, invention, and shipbuilding. </p>



<p>For almost 200 years, the statue of the celebrated Scottish inventor and engineer James Watt has stood in George Square. Every schoolchild is taught about the invention of the steam engine in 1776, which was fundamental to the changes brought by the Industrial Revolution across the world. What’s less well known is that Watt’s father was a slave trader, a colonial merchant who subsidised his son. The development of the steam engine was funded by slavery. Watt himself was involved in colonial commerce and played a direct role in the trafficking of enslaved people. </p>



<p>With Glasgow playing host to the COP in 2021, we have historical symmetry. It’s more of a loop than a continuum; as the world faces climate catastrophe, the same city that was pivotal in the Industrial Revolution, colonisation, and Empire is the city that must now be the pivot towards decolonisation and degrowth. </p>



<p>Mirroring the challenge facing humanity itself, the city of Glasgow needs to find ways to move beyond the old story that it has become defined by. This is not just about moving beyond an industrial legacy and identity; it’s about moving beyond a history of violence and ongoing destruction. Like the abandoned coalfields that pockmark Fife and Ayrshire, the empty docks that still line the Clyde speak to communities left to mass unemployment and intergenerational trauma. For Glasgow, and for the rest of us, degrowth is about finding ways of living and being beyond our obsession with productivity and consumption and GDP. It’s about working towards a radical&nbsp;transformation of our society to one which serves a new function: supporting the flourishing and sustaining of life. </p>



<p>The path towards this transformation or ‘transition’ is faint and hard to make out. Any movement of change left to market forces motivated by profits and constrained within the economics of globalisation – a political and economic ideology based on exploitative practices towards people, land, and nature – will follow the same inevitable path to destruction. After a year in the trauma of the pandemic, the climate crisis came to Europe. Extreme weather visited the Global North with an unrecognisable summer of flooding, wildfires, and extreme heat. Even the most complacent were woken from their slumbers to confront a present and future of climate emergency that can no longer be ignored. We are heading full steam into a world of fossil-fuel expansion and mass extinction of species, including our own. As the IPPC report stated, we are living in “code red for humanity: the alarm bells are deafening, and the evidence is irrefutable.” </p>



<p>Yet, incredibly, the Prime Minister – of the UK government Scotland did not elect – is preparing to sign off on a new drilling permit at Cambo oilfield, west of Shetland.1 If approved, Cambo would produce 170m barrels of oil and would deepen the climate crisis for decades to come. [2] It is a staggeringly backward move, an exercise in futility and, ultimately, a crime against humanity. In Scotland, we don’t have full democratic control over our future path, and in this situation there is an echo of the climate predicament. In a world where greenwash and disinformation dominate, it’s easy to feel alienated and see only the futility of the process. </p>



<p>The COP26 Coalition joined calls for the summit’s postponement, stating: <br><br><strong>“As the clock ticks on this crucial decade, rich countries must commit to doing their fair share of climate action, cutting emissions to zero and paying their carbon debt to the global South. This is the bare minimum needed to pave the way for a successful COP26, yet the COP Presidency is far from showing such leadership [&#8230;] From climate to Covid the UK has shown it is willing to sacrifice those worst off to shore up huge profits for the few.” [3] </strong></p>



<p>The challenge is not to be consumed by the huge gravitational pull and distraction of COP – its hype, its false hope, its unreality, its greenwashed credentials and stagemanaged accords. The challenge is to organise within communities and resist the police state, to speak the truth, to cultivate outrage, to create a rupture, to challenge inevitability, and to imagine, articulate, and build different futures. Our humantiy and our home is under threat. </p>



<p><strong>BEING HUMAN </strong></p>



<p>IF, AS THE IPCC stated: “All pathways begin now and involve rapid and unprecedented social transformation”, then Glasgow has a radical political history to inspire the movement. </p>

<p>Glasgow is not just a city of Empire built on exploitation; it is also a city built on struggle. Whether it’s Mary Barbour’s rent strikes or John Maclean and Red Clydeside in the early 20th century, Jimmy Reid and the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders of 1971, the anti-Polaris and CND movement, the Anti-Poll Tax Campaign, the anti-apartheid movement, Pollok Free State in the 1990s, the Kenmure Street protest of 2021 or the countless unsung pockets of radical and inspired action in the communities that make up the fabric of the city, there is much to learn from Glasgow’s radical past. </p>



<p>Other sources of local inspiration include Jimmy Reid’s Rectorial Address to the University of Glasgow in 1972, a speech that has had reverberations and resonance down the years. He could be speaking to us directly today: </p>



<p><strong>“Let me right at the outset define what I mean by alienation. It is the cry of men who feel themselves the victims of blind economic forces beyond their control. It is the frustration of ordinary people excluded from the processes of decision making. The feeling of despair and hopelessness that pervades people who feel with justification that they have no real say in shaping or determining their own destinies. [&#8230;] Reject these attitudes. Reject the values and false morality that underlie these attitudes. A rat race is for rats. We’re not rats. We’re human beings.” </strong></p>



<p>Some of the critique of the climate crisis turns on humanity; claiming, with the spectre of ecofascism looming, that “We humans are the problem.”. The answer for Reid is not less humanity but less capitalism. The power structures that have emerged threaten and undermine our hard won democratic rights. His words echo down the ages: </p>



<p><strong>“Government by the people for the people becomes meaningless unless it includes major economic decision making by the people for the people. This is not simply an economic matter. In essence it is an ethical and moral question, for whoever decisions in society ipso facto determines the social priorities of that society.” </strong></p>



<p>Our global economy is structured so that disproportionate, dangerous, and unprecedented amounts of wealth and power are centralised and held by the people and multi-national corporations involved in excessive extractive industries driving climate breakdown and ecosystem collapse. They are taking decisions which are not in the interests of you, me, or the billions of people and diverse ecosystems on this planet. In degrowth, we have an opportunity to transfer power away from those bodies towards more democratic structures and processes that centre care and lifesustaining work. We need to shift towards an economy away from growth-at-anycost to an economy that is feminist in the sense of the late Scottish economist Ailsa Mackay [4] and as outlined by Maria Mies [5] : </p>



<p><strong>“The feminist project is basically an anarchist movement which does not want to replace one (male) power elite by another (female) power elite, but which wants to build up a non-hierarchical, non-centralised society where no elite lives off exploitation and dominance over others.” </strong></p>

<p>We also need new mechanisms to sustainably ‘govern the commons’, as sketched out by Elinor Ostrom [6] – which include restoring our oceans and the atmosphere in service of the greater good. Any framework for transitioning to an alternative economic system that does not account for the massive global restructuring of power relations needed – and which does not understand this as a political project – will not deliver the transformation that is needed for everyone – human and more-thanhuman – to live well and flourish on the planet we call home.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We present to you LESS’s ‘Code Red’ issue not simply as a response to the COP, but as a space for voices from the centre to the margins of the struggle for climate justice, degrowth, and decolonisation.</p>



<p> Benjamin Brown makes the case for shutting down the Mossmorran Natural Gas Liquids plant in Fife. Paul Routledge, Gehan Macleod, and David Lees write about the GalGael Free State as an autonomous zone near the ‘blue zone’ where climate talks are talking place. Luke Devlin interviews Craig Bryce about rebel DIY housebuilding and the autonomy that comes with building collectives. Rhyddian Knight interviews David Blair about the ark he built on the Cowal peninsula to highlight the plight of coastal communities. Peter Kitelo Chongeywo of the Ogiek Indigenous Forest Peoples of Mount Elgon, Kenya, sees climate change activism in the UK as fighting for all our tomorrows. Kate Chambers writes about the need to decouple social mobility from resource consumption. Mark Langdon reflects on education for transformation as a crucial tool in a time of ecological and social crisis. Svenja Meyerricks interviews climate justice activist Nomalizo Xhoma in Johannesburg about the COP and community struggles in South Africa. Catriona Spaven-Donn argues for commons food systems that are grounded in collaborative relationships between plants and fungi. And, finally, Vishwam Heckert reflects on the need to unlearn Empire and abstraction and disconnection by unlearning the embodied and psychic habit of separating ‘us’ and ‘them’ or ‘me’ from the ‘world’. </p>



<p>The Dear Green Place is the perfect venue for COP, where all the contradictions and complexities of our past, present, and possible futures are laid bare. Glasgow is a site of both colonisation and decolonisation, imperialism and anti-imperialism. It is a city disfigured by poverty and scarred by violence, exploitation, and trauma. It is also a city of resistance, hospitality, political radicalism, and hope. From Glasgow, we need to forge a world where we are no longer “the victims of blind economic forces beyond our control.” [7]&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The choice is endless growth of global capital or life on earth. It’s a choice we are each going to have to keep fighting for every day.<br><br><strong>COP DISTRIBUTION</strong></p>

<p>There is much talk about ‘Green Economy’ or ‘Green Growth’ as the main solution to climate change. In this teach-in we will examine the fundamental problems of the narratives of Green Growth, how it is preserving a status quo that will further accelerate climate breakdown. In the second part, we’ll take a look at Degrowth as an alternative for a just and social transformation of our society.</p>

<p>Degrowth, while a general critique of our global state of affairs, is fundamentally a situated approach and makes sense for the Global South as an anti-colonial project. Green Growth is pushed as a new language of imperialism in places like Chile and in “energy transitions” initiatives. This teach-in highlights the resistance to the “growth at all costs” that emerges from communities defending their territories and different cosmologies and frames degrowth as a project of global solidarity and human needs.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">We are currently seeking contributions to our upcoming issue <strong>LESS #3</strong>:<strong> Degrowth and Decolonisation in the Red Zone</strong></h3>



<p>The recent<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> IPPC report</a> signals the latest three-alarm warning for humanity and the biosphere. It&#8217;s a red alert for the &#8216;red zone&#8217;- those areas of our planet responsible for the most emissions, which are also now squarely in the floodplain- including Scotland. </p>



<p>Beyond COP26, we invite contributions that focus on Scottish resistance to the climate crisis. The story emerging so far on the road to COP26 from mainstream commentators and media, party politics and corporate PR is that we can carry on industrial civilisation as per usual, by simply inserting a renewably-powered battery in the same old machine. This approach will almost certainly lead to collapse. Rather, we&#8217;re interested in clues and trails that lead away from this collision with planetary limits.  We seek responses that reflect grounded lived practice and fresh-thinking through degrowth and decolonisation to create a future-focused and outward looking climate justice movement. This needs innovation that responds to our times, as well as recovering traditional ecological and cultural knowledge, especially within a Scottish context, which can help restore fragments of meaning in our times of metacrisis. <br><br><strong>Submissions:</strong> We invite a combination of thoroughly researched material, opinion pieces, poetry and art work from those with lived knowledge in these areas, researchers, poets, creative writers and artists. If you&#8217;re interested in submitting a piece, please have a look at our <a href="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LESS.pdf">guidelines for contributors</a> and send us a short summary or abstract of your idea to less@enough.scot asap. We aim to have selected contributors by the end of August. The deadline for finished pieces is 4th October, and we pay a fee of £240.</p>



<p><strong>LESS is a journal on degrowth, radical sufficiency and decolonisation in Scotland.</strong> LESS questions and challenges dominant narratives about what economic progress means in Scotland, and sketches out alternative visions. The focus is on collective and democratic solutions to sustaining livelihoods that meet people’s needs while rising to the threats of climate change, ecocide and mass extinction, inequality, racism and the far right, and the interconnected oppressive and extractivist logic and mechanisms that feed all of those.<br><br><strong>Editorial team:</strong> Mike Small, Dr Mairi McFadyen, Dr Svenja Meyerricks and Luke Devlin</p>

<p></p>



<p>The fashion industry is among the most polluting industries on the planet. It is fraught with ethical atrocities, inherently resource-hungry and, some might claim, entirely unnecessary – in utilitarian terms we have produced enough clothing and textiles to meet the needs of our global population for generations.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, we remain unsated and, even in the face of a global economic recession (combined with a growing awareness of the imminent, terrifying consequences of overconsumption), it is predicted that this year we will <em>still</em> produce over 100 billion garments.<a href="#sdendnote1sym"><sup>i</sup></a></p>



<p>It seems like a kind of madness, a collective hysteria so deeply entrenched and on such a scale that it almost forbids confrontation. But the future of our species demands that we change; the unacceptable exploitation of garment workers demands that we change; the current levels of pollution in our rivers, our oceans and our soil demand that we change.</p>



<p>This article aims to illustrate how a revitalised, locally made clothing economy is a degrowth approach that would create meaningful employment, enrich communities and challenge toxic mindsets about how we view ourselves, each other and the clothing we inhabit.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>



<p>Imagine a city, and in this city are 30 bespoke tailors, making suits and coats for their clients. The tailors have known and provided service to their clients for decades. They know about each other’s families, hobbies, hopes and disappointments. Their lives are interconnected &#8211; tailor and client, friend and neighbour, citizens of a shared place. Now imagine 23 dressmakers, creating outfits for their clients in every colour of the rainbow, realising dreams of wedding dresses, or the perfect summer blouse. They too form relationships; the exchange of money is necessary, but it does not corrode the connection. There exists a respect for learned craft and design talent, for listening and for creativity. There is something special, and ultimately something deeply human here. Now imagine 22 shirtmakers, 21 milliners (hat makers) and 5 shoemakers, all building those relationships, honing their crafts, and existing in this diverse marketplace of locally made clothing. And the craftspeople of this great, diverse, creative city are not hidden out of sight in obscure back-lanes or industrial zones- they are in the heart of bustling city life, with visible shop fronts on high streets for all the population to see, know, and feel that good things are made here.</p>



<p>This is not a utopia or a dream that I am describing, neither is it London’s Mayfair (one of the last great remaining districts of craftspeople in the United Kingdom). What I am describing is the city of Glasgow in 1968<a href="#sdendnote2sym"><sup>ii</sup></a>, a city with a population similar in size to today’s, where poverty was rife &#8211; yet it supported a local industry of skilled craftspeople. If population and wealth are any indicators, the city should be able to support a visible local clothing industry now, so why not make clothes in Glasgow? Why not make clothes locally in Scotland? Why not grow new (and support existing) locally made clothing economies around the globe? I believe that looking to our past is more than an exercise in bittersweet nostalgia, but instead could help inform a blueprint for a sustainable future.</p>



<p>A locally made clothing economy is by nature a degrowth economy; recent research estimates that the global fashion industry will produce over 100 billion garments this year<a href="#sdendnote3sym"><sup>iii</sup></a>. This is an incredibly hard figure to visualise. It would be unlikely to see those numbers replicated in a global industry formed of localised clothing economies, and powered by individuals and small teams of makers. The fantastic thing about degrowth (inherent in switching to a localised economy) is that you can gather support for rebuilding a diverse, local marketplace from a much broader section of the population than those who might typically engage with critiques of capitalism – and without ever mentioning the term “degrowth”.</p>



<p>In the UK alone it is estimated that the fashion industry spends £241 million on advertising<a href="#sdendnote4sym"><sup>iv</sup></a>. With increasingly powerful tactics, facilitated by social media platforms and the cultures that have emerged from them, a growth-focused fashion industry is in a better position than ever to convince us to buy, dispose, repeat. A small brand in Dundee making t-shirts, or a tailor in Edinburgh making bespoke suits, might employ the occasional use of online adverts, or use social media platforms to promote their business. Their powers of persuasion however, and ability to purchase space in the ‘attention economy’, pale in comparison to big brands, (particularly those with high-status associations) and they lack an incentive to seize the attention of whole nations with large campaigns. It is my belief that a fashion industry constituted from thousands of small and micro businesses, would create a very different culture of consumption.</p>



<p>In our current context, where there exists an urgent need for reducing material consumption, the inherent production limitations of local brands and makers becomes their strength. This is absolutely the case with small, localised fashion brands (producing limited runs of ‘ready-to-wear’ collections). Taking this further, in terms of limiting unnecessary consumption and changing buying habits, some of the most interesting (and often overlooked) potential lies in bespoke. A bespoke garment sits outside the mainstream fashion industry, is not subject to trends and does not require an advertising campaign. It is a carefully considered purchase, partly due to the expense involved in purchasing it, but for deeper reasons too – it requires consideration, thought, discussion and collaboration between customer and maker. Commissioning a bespoke garment is a ‘high friction’ transaction; fabric must be chosen, shape decided upon, number of pockets agreed etc. and that is before the making can even begin, with some, more complex bespoke garments requiring 6 or more months to create. It requires real consideration and it also requires patience, two practices the ‘low friction’ experience of shopping ready-to-wear online would have us avoid and ultimately forget how to exercise.</p>



<p>The term ‘bespoke’ has become synonymous with tailoring, in particular luxury tailoring, but, when I write ‘bespoke’, I am not just referring to three-piece formal suits. It is defined as ‘made for a particular customer or user’ and so, today, a bespoke clothing economy (as part of a wider, local clothing marketplace) would more likely manifest in bespoke jeans, bespoke sweatshirts, bespoke t-shirts and bespoke casual dresses. In fact, any item of clothing you are wearing right now could be bespoke. In the last 100 years, societies across the globe have challenged every kind of clothing rule and taboo, whilst becoming gradually entrenched in thinking that clothing <em>must</em> come from brands, not fellow citizens. If people were able to re-engage with the concept of buying bespoke, the possibilities for true individual expression and creativity reach new heights. In this way, a degrowth clothing economy is not about austerity and reducing individual freedoms; it is about increasing creativity and empowering self-expression in a way that the current mainstream fashion industry does not allow.</p>



<p>Wasteful and resource hungry is the true state of the fashion industry today. Entirely preventable waste occurs at every stage of its production, sale and use. Some waste is difficult to prevent; for example, in order to avoid producing waste fabric offcuts during production, garments would need to be designed using a zero-waste approach and this can be challenging (but not impossible) for mainstream brands to implement. The mass burning or burying of unsold garments to protect brand identity is a practice that is hard to defend. Burberry was famously outed for this practice<a href="#sdendnote5sym"><sup>v</sup></a> but they are only one of the many companies adopting this strategy for a problem which is simply ‘just having too much stuff’. This story provoked public outrage but, if we picture it at a personal level, it can be easier to comprehend. How many of us have ever felt overwhelmed at the number of possessions we have (be that clothing or something else) and, in a fit of ‘decluttering’, condemned bags of unwanted items to the local charity shop or, in more desperate moments, the bin. If we are to tangibly tackle the problem of textile waste, we must acknowledge that responsibility exists with, and beyond, global brands. We too have an impact &#8211; currently it is estimated that the global population sends the equivalent of a rubbish truck of clothing to landfill every second<a href="#sdendnote6sym"><sup>vi</sup></a>.</p>



<p>When we hear statistics about tonnage of textile waste, we can start to feel its burden build upon our backs, to the point where we feel paralysed, incapable of meaningful action. One of the many exciting things about a revitalised, locally made clothing economy is that it gives us tools to not only reduce the amount of waste we produce, but also to begin to see “waste” in an entirely different way.</p>



<p>Firstly, a fashion industry composed of small brands and makers would not have the manufacturing capability to create anywhere near the same levels of waste that we are witnessing right now. It is also unlikely that smaller businesses would ever need or want to burn or bury unsold garments. When you are directly connected to the making process, you are much more invested in your garments because you have been a part of the hours it took to create them. It would be a very unusual set of circumstances that would cause an independent designer to burn a collection they had spent several months creating. I <em>still </em>have pieces I made from when I was first learning how to sew (over a decade ago), and I expect that I will still have those pieces in 10 years’ time.</p>



<p>A strong local clothing economy is likely to be a connected and social network, able to share resources and facilities to reduce waste and production costs for all. Taking an example from my own practice; prior to the pandemic, most of my commissions were wedding dresses or men’s suits – traditional styles for formal occasions &#8211; and these clients were not interested in experimenting with interesting seam placement that could minimise waste. Why should they be? Even with the most economical lay plan (the way pattern pieces are nestled together for cutting, kind of like Tetris), I always produce small waste pieces that will very rarely be of use to me. In a connected, diverse local clothing economy, I would know exactly who those scraps would be useful to; in this way one designers’ trash becomes another designers’ treasure, waste and costs are reduced for both parties, and a culture of reciprocity would emerge.</p>



<p>Independent designers and makers are much more agile than global brands; they can quickly make use of pre- and post-consumer waste whenever opportunities present themselves or even make it a central part of their business model. In fact, they are already leading the way in this. Taking an example from Glasgow, upcycling brand ReJean Denim repurposes deadstock denim and preloved jeans into new, timeless pieces and offers a mending service to make sure the garment has as long a life as possible. This requires skill, but it also requires imagination – seeing waste as an opportunity, rather than a problem.</p>



<p>Exploring the problem of waste imaginatively &#8211; how long might a city such as Glasgow be able to sustain a diverse, creative clothing economy if all materials had to be sourced with city limits? Given the huge number of garments languishing in charity shops, clothing bins, textile recycling centres and even our own wardrobes, I doubt that designers would find themselves too limited if they only sourced their textiles locally – and, if they did, might it be worth exploring the value of this limitation? And might we start to question the notion that creative endeavour should never be limited, no matter the costs to our environment? Like most cities, we have fantastic local textile resources; we may not be able to grow cotton in Scotland, but we certainly have a lot of cotton right here already to work with. Truly imaginative designers can work with what they have in front of them, and we have so much.</p>



<p>The fast fashion culture we currently live in inevitably compromises quality to deliver at such a pace. Of course, there have always been varying levels of quality throughout the history of clothing production, but it is only in the last 50 or 60 years that we have seen the prevalence of planned obsolescence grow in the fashion industry. The big brands do not expect you to wear their garments more than 8-10 times, so why take the extra time in production to make them last 300 washes? A local clothing economy cannot exist in this manner. Local businesses depend on customer loyalty, online reviews, and word-of-mouth to maintain their clients. Furthermore, a disgruntled customer in a local clothing economy can have a greater impact than simply leaving a bad review; they can walk into your shop or visit your studio and demand a repair or refund in person. There is accountability, a necessary aspect of any healthy community.</p>



<p>Designers who have a role in the production of their collections will see the value in making something well for its own sake (the philosophy of a craftsman<a href="#sdendnote7sym"><sup>vii</sup></a>) and, with many designers running ‘own name’ labels, who would want their name on a poorly made garment? Moreover, when you are working with or selling directly toa customer, there forms a human connection, a sense of obligation – that person has chosen <em>you</em> to make something, something that will touch their skin, keep them warm, change the way they feel about themselves. Amancio Ortega, billionaire and owner of Inditex (a fashion conglomerate that includes Zara, Bershka and Massimo Dutti) is unlikely to lose sleep when your Zara t-shirt starts to fall apart or when your jeans zip has broken after 2 wears and, regardless of how he might feel about either of these things, <em>you cannot access him</em>. As the writer Matthew Crawford says, “it&#8217;s this sense that there&#8217;s no one you can grab hold of by the lapels and hold to account…. that&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the definition of tyranny: power that is not accountable…and is not operating with your best interests at heart”.<a href="#sdendnote8sym"><sup>viii</sup></a></p>



<p>You can complain at your local Zara shop, write a post on Instagram, even post the faulty garment back in protest- but are any of these tactics likely to raise production and material standards at Zara? A local clothing economy has to, and wants to, produce high quality clothing – it is essential to its survival, justifying the necessary higher price points. Furthermore, making things well is fundamental to the philosophy shared by most people who make their own products. By making things that last and being locally accessible to offer repairs, a locally made clothing economy reduces waste, builds relationships and restores customer respect and appreciation for ‘a job well done’; no global brand can offer this.</p>



<p>But what about those who cannot afford to participate in a locally made clothing economy? The reality is that locally made clothing cannot and should not compete with the likes of Primark and BooHoo – in rebuilding a locally made industry, we do not want to copy the environmental or human exploitation of the global fashion industry. This requires a shift in thinking about the numbers of new clothes we can purchase per year. For a lot of people, buying locally <em>is</em> possible but it will mean buying less. In the context of Scotland, this may not be possible for those on the lowest incomes, even to meet their basic practical clothing needs. The city of Glasgow has some of the highest levels of deprivation in Western Europe and, whilst secondhand clothing can play a part here, we know that there exists real, understandable stigmas and shame around wearing secondhand. We must acknowledge that and be hopeful that revitalising a local clothing economy will just be one part of revitalising cities more broadly, and that by investing in the local makers, more jobs and better outcomes will be generated for the wider population. This is not ‘trickle-down’ economics as we have witnessed it, which in the words of Jason Hickel has been ‘barely even a vapour’<a href="#sdendnote9sym"><sup>ix</sup></a>, this is local investment with local beneficiaries. The fact that people cannot afford to buy a locally made £17 t-shirt (versus a £2 equivalent at Primark) is an indicator of poverty caused by an economy that needs to be urgently addressed politically, not through independent makers being paid less.</p>



<p>In the transition to a thriving local clothing economy, it is important that a broad range of tastes are catered for by local makers – for real change, this cannot be something solely for the sustainability-conscious middle classes. We need to bring along as many people as possible and everybody needs to feel welcome on the journey. One way to do this would be to reinstate local business in the heart of city centres. Why shouldn’t a visit to Glasgow’s famous ‘style mile’ on Buchanan Street bring you into contact with local fashion brands, tailors and dressmakers? Why has it become the norm that this territory belongs to global brands and conglomerates only? Brands who are happy to remove themselves when the going-gets-tough, leaving unemployment and desolate department stores behind them. These cities, these spaces, do not belong to global brands – they belong to us, the citizens.</p>



<p>At the beginning of this article I asked you to imagine <em>a</em> city, now I want you to imagine <em>your</em> city (or closest city, wherever that might be). Imagine all the shops, vacated through lockdown and recession, now populated with a diverse range of local makers. Imagine walking past a window, previously boarded up, lit bright and displaying a garment that was carefully made and <em>made there</em> – you may even be able to see the designer at work towards the back of the shop. Imagine a long-ignored, faded department store, re-painted and re-populated with local businesses. Imagine visiting other cities and discovering that city’s local talent and unique fashion scene – not a carbon copy of global brand after global brand. If local authorities and government wanted to make this happen, they absolutely could, they could certainly make a start &#8211; it just takes the will, and a bit of imagination.</p>

<p>This is from #2 of LESS &#8211; our journal of degrowth, radical sufficiency and decolonisation in Scotland. <a href="https://www.enough.scot/less/">Details of how to get a print copy here.</a></p>



<p></p>



<p><em><u>Steel</u></em></p>



<p>I place my palm en la reja called border wall.</p>



<p>Let its steel enter my body: iron alloyed with carbon</p>



<p>hardened to prevent the<em> movement of</em> <em>dislocations.</em></p>



<p>I am in Tijuana, looking at California through the bars</p>



<p>though it isn’t clear where the prison lies.</p>



<p>To my left the bars peter out into an ocean</p>



<p>whose waves refuse to be contained.</p>



<p>The body of an adult human</p>



<p>contains about four grams of iron;</p>



<p>all four of mine rush to meet la reja imantada.</p>



<p>When we speak of magnetism,</p>



<p>we think of love, or charisma,</p>



<p>or crowds of faces all in one direction.</p>



<p>But never of iron as the metal</p>



<p>at the active site of many enzymes</p>



<p>dealing with cellular respiration</p>



<p>or the pull towards a ‘better life’.</p>



<p>Glasgow’s sandstone tenements, incidentally,</p>



<p>are red because they contain iron.</p>



<p>Our blood stone is iron ore.</p>



<p>It emanates its own light.</p>



<p>We are the blood, migrating</p>



<p>bringing cargo</p>



<p>from one cell to the next</p>



<p>keeping the body alive, we transport</p>



<p>mercancía</p>



<p>maquinaria</p>



<p>manos</p>



<p>más.</p>



<p>The iron for the wall was mined in the M states</p>



<p>bordering with Canada.</p>



<p>Not that long ago, the land was cleared</p>



<p>of its people, wildlife and forests.</p>



<p>Migrants from Europe fed the logs down the rivers</p>



<p>laid the train tracks</p>



<p>peeled away life on the topsoil</p>



<p>bloodlet the earth to build</p>



<p>this line of steel</p>



<p>marking the limits of possession.</p>



<p>Praying from Carnegie’s <em>Gospel of Wealth</em></p>



<p>which built an empire of steel</p>



<p>repeating that this was progress</p>



<p>away from universal squalor</p>



<p>we were able to steal our eyes away</p>



<p>from the impoverishment</p>



<p>of the lands</p>



<p>—now empty red pits</p>



<p>gaping red wounds</p>



<p>as far as the eye can see.</p>



<p></p>



<p><em><u>The Letter M</u></em></p>



<p>With a guru’s moustache and a penchant for conspiracy</p>



<p>the madman explains to me that language is a form of mind control</p>



<p>the grammar itself holding us in a bind</p>



<p>– an incantation muttered over millenia</p>



<p>shaping our thoughts.</p>



<p>I want to master the art of the pictogram, he says.</p>



<p>It is the earliest form of writing</p>



<p>is uncontaminated by the misers, the drive for accumulation</p>



<p>created with the rise of agriculture.</p>



<p>The letter M, for example, is the pictogram of a wave</p>



<p>we forget where it comes from, it loses all meaning</p>



<p>we write it over and over without ever thinking of water</p>



<p>or how maritime and motherly,</p>



<p>muro y morada are of one essence.</p>



<p>As he speaks, I watch the surfers glide along the lip of the perfect breakers</p>



<p>almost for the whole line of the horizon</p>



<p>before they topple over into the sea</p>



<p>like tiny plastic soldiers.</p>



<p>That night we slept hearing the waves crash onto the rocks</p>



<p>and in the morning, we knew we were rocks too.</p>



<p>Our hearts, hardened lava.</p>



<p>The Pacific had smoothed round windows through us</p>



<p>and like a Barbara Hepworth sculpture</p>



<p>we were made whole</p>



<p>by what we lack.</p>



<p></p>



<p><em><u>Storylines</u></em></p>



<p>Roads are heavier on the rich side of the line.</p>



<p>Asphalt mixed with cement is whiter</p>



<p>loudening under car wheels, it hardens over time,</p>



<p>requiring little maintenance.</p>



<p>Such are the roads of the first world.</p>



<p>But the dwellings there are transient</p>



<p>wooden-framed and lighter</p>



<p>as if to be filled with</p>



<p>cushions and the crinkle of food wrappers</p>



<p>and some child’s quiet voice in a corner of the room</p>



<p>mouthing</p>



<p>and I’ll huff</p>



<p>and I’ll puff.</p>



<p>On the other side of the line</p>



<p>the asphalt grows crocodile-skinned.</p>



<p>Pockmarked and permeable,</p>



<p>it can cope with earthquakes</p>



<p>and melt in the sun.</p>



<p>Initially it’s cheaper to lay</p>



<p>but has a shorter lifespan.</p>



<p>Such the roads of the third world.</p>



<p>But here, our houses</p>



<p>you can tell by just looking at them</p>



<p>are made of cement, heavy as pyramids</p>



<p>as if to hold us at home</p>



<p>for longer.</p>



<p></p>
