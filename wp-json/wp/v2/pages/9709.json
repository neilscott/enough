Theona and Thomas talk to us about land ownership, cultural expression, language and community cohesion in rural Scotland. They explain how a decolonial approach can be utilised by focusing on a community&#8217;s assets rather than its deficits and moving away from highly planned systems to a process-based approach that are inclusive, dynamic, and fluid in terms of its outcome.

Theona is Chair of Scottish Rural Action. Theona sits on the UHI Post Graduate committee (nursing and midwifery) and Community Land Scotland\u2019s working group to develop curriculum materials embodying the opportunities within community land ownership. Theona has lived in Uist for over 30 years, previously she worked for a multination corporate company at senior level which provided an insight into global trading; the polar opposite to the local economic model which sustained the islands for generations and which can lead the way for the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas Fisher is a founding Director of CoDeL.&nbsp; He led the international partnership for the NPA-funded research on economic impacts of Covid which led to the call to redefine peripherality, to view island and rural communities through a new and very different lens, rooted in the experience of island life in the Outer Hebrides.Thomas has lived in Uist for almost 20 years, engaging in diverse community development roles and projects, including for children and young people. Formerly Director for Enterprising Communities at the new economics foundation and Visiting Fellow at IDS, Sussex University, Thomas worked for many years in rural development in India, working with Tibetan refugees and a range of Indian development organisations, and has published three books on rural non-farm employment and micro-finance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Episode 4 &#8211; Lauren Pyott and Matt Baker<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/anchor.fm\/nico-ndlovu\/embed\/episodes\/Degrowth-in-Scotland-Episode-4-e1fcg82\/a-a7hk6la\" height=\"102px\" width=\"400px\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>In episode four of Degrowth in Scotland, Nico speaks with Lauren Pyott, founder and managing director of Clachworks, a social enterprise in Inverness that plans to open a socially inclusive space for making and remaking in a heritage workshop building on the Caledonian Cana.

Matt talks to us about ideas for developing a radical approach to the way we &#8216;do&#8217; culture in Scotland, with a shift towards mass participation in culture rather than what we have now &#8211; a passive consumption of culture that is produced by a privileged and exclusive cultural workforce.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Featured guests: This week&#8217;s podcast featured Lauren Pyott and Matt Baker.
