wall.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let its steel enter my body: iron alloyed with carbon<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>hardened to prevent the<em> movement of<\/em> <em>dislocations.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am in Tijuana, looking at California through the bars<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>though it isn\u2019t clear where the prison lies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To my left the bars peter out into an ocean<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>whose waves refuse to be contained.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The body of an adult human<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>contains about four grams of iron;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>all four of mine rush to meet la reja imantada.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we speak of magnetism,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>we think of love, or charisma,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>or crowds of faces all in one direction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But never of iron as the metal<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>at the active site of many enzymes<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>dealing with cellular respiration<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>or the pull towards a \u2018better life\u2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Glasgow\u2019s sandstone tenements, incidentally,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>are red because they contain iron.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our blood stone is iron ore.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It emanates its own light.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are the blood, migrating<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>bringing cargo<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>from one cell to the next<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>keeping the body alive, we

with Canada.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not that long ago, the land was cleared<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>of its people, wildlife and forests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Migrants from Europe fed the logs down the rivers<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>laid the train tracks<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>peeled away life on the topsoil<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>bloodlet the earth to build<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>this line of steel<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>marking the limits of possession.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Praying from Carnegie\u2019s <em>Gospel of Wealth<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>which built an empire of steel<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>repeating that this was progress<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>away from universal squalor<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>we were able to steal our eyes away<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>from the impoverishment<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>of the lands<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2014now empty red pits<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>gaping red wounds<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>as far as the eye can see.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><u>The Letter M<\/u><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a guru\u2019s moustache and a penchant for conspiracy<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>the madman explains to me that language is a form of mind control<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>the grammar itself holding us in a bind<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2013 an incantation muttered over millenia<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>shaping our thoughts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to master the art of the pictogram, he says.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is the earliest form of writing<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>is uncontaminated by the misers, the drive for accumulation<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>created with the rise of agriculture.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The letter M, for example, is the pictogram of a wave<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>we forget where it comes from, it loses all meaning<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>we write it over and over without ever thinking of water<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>or how maritime and motherly,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>muro y morada are of one essence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As he speaks, I watch the surfers glide along the lip of the perfect breakers<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>almost for the whole line of the horizon<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>before they topple over into the sea<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>like tiny plastic soldiers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That night we slept hearing the waves crash onto the rocks<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>and in the morning, we knew we were rocks too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our hearts, hardened lava.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pacific had smoothed round windows through us<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>and like a Barbara Hepworth sculpture<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>we were made whole<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>by what we lack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><u>Storylines<\/u><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roads are heavier on the rich side of the line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asphalt mixed with cement is whiter<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>loudening under car wheels, it hardens over time,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>requiring little maintenance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such are the roads of the first world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the dwellings there are transient<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>wooden-framed and lighter<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>as if to be filled with<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>cushions and the crinkle of food wrappers<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>and some child\u2019s quiet voice in a corner of the room<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>mouthing<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>and I\u2019ll huff<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>and I\u2019ll puff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other side of the line<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>the asphalt grows crocodile-skinned.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pockmarked and permeable,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>it can cope with earthquakes<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>and melt in the sun.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially it\u2019s cheaper to lay<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>but has a shorter lifespan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such the roads of the third world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But here, our houses<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>you can tell by just looking at them<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>are made of cement, heavy as pyramids<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>as if to hold us at home<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>for
