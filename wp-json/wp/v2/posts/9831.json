Illustrations by Deborah Mullen.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Degrowth is a big tent, peopled by ecological economists, political ecologists, activists, (eco)feminists, anthropologists, artists, researchers, students, political scientists, sociologists, and many more. Participants in a social movement, degrowthers are often both researchers and activists. They provide compelling answers to the question of how to live well and equitably within social and environmental limits. To address socially and ecologically harmful productivism and overconsumption, the initial focus lay on self-limitation, expressed in concepts such as \u2018voluntary simplicity\u2019 or \u2018frugal abundance\u2019. (1) Sustainable degrowth aims to democratically reduce consumption and production levels. (2) These notions are being pushed by post\/decolonial thinkers, feminists, anti-racist activists, and environmental justice movements from the Global South, who complement this individualised, quantified approach to degrowth with a <em>pluriverse <\/em>of economic practices that centre care, communal resource governance, and diverse knowledges as conditions for the reproduction of life. (3)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can see that changes to our consumption, production, and working patterns alone won\u2019t be enough to sustain a profound transformation towards a just and sustainable world. To understand the deeper shifts that are required, we need to look at cultural aspects of socio-ecological transformations. So what would it mean to put a <em>cosmological <\/em>limit to growth? Namely, limits that arise from our cosmology \u2013 that is, the way we see the world, knowledge, our own destiny, the role of nature, and so on. (4) To help degrowth thought and practice grapple with this question, this article brings degrowth into conversation with <em>Buen Vivir<\/em>, an indigenous principle and decolonial practice of \u2018Good Living\u2019 from Latin America. The first part looks into perceptions that see degrowth as an anthropocentric \u2013 and thereby Eurocentric \u2013 movement. The second part introduces <em>Buen Vivir<\/em> and explains why a dialogue between the two helps overcome degrowth\u2019s human-centred analysis. This section also sets out the importance of \u2018cosmological limits to growth\u2019 for cultural elements of sustainability transformations. The last part sketches out what \u2018cosmological limits to growth\u2019 can mean in practice. The ideas put forward in this article are based on my PhD, for which I conducted research in Ecuador. In early 2020, I interviewed 15 social leaders, community members, and politicians, and observed public meetings and municipal, nongovernmental, and indigenous assemblies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Degrowth\u2019s Colonial Nature<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The political project, social movement, and field of study that is degrowth is a broad church. In it, you\u2019ll find a broad range of knowledges and worldviews, contingent on the different disciplines\u2019 methodologies and location within the natural and social sciences, humanities, or arts. There has been early criticism, however, of a tendency within degrowth to articulate a political critique of economic growth that is based on a narrow, anthropocentric view of the environment, and pays too little attention to colonial-era, hierarchical identity systems that continue to constrain equitable resource access. (5) This may be surprising, given degrowth\u2019s core argument is that the economy is, in fact, embedded within a planetary ecosystem. The majority of early degrowth literature adopted this argument and worldview from the discipline of ecological economics, which seeks to dispel the strict nature\/culture divide prevalent in our current understanding of the world, an inheritance of neoclassical economics. This divide is argued to be the underlying cause of ecological breakdown and \u2018market failures\u2019 such as pollution and waste (Fig.1). (6) However, the critique of growth put forward by ecological economics is based on the concept of \u2018ecosystems\u2019, from which, in a simplified manner, societies \u201creceive inputs from the earth, the atmosphere, and the waters, and [to which] they give outputs\u201d.

Yet, it also objectifies living beings, together with other abiotic elements like rocks and minerals. It detaches them from their cultural values, and the political processes that shape landscapes, societies, and histories. The nature\/culture divide, for example, formed the cosmological basis of colonial plantation economies, which served as blueprints for industrial manufacturing in England and elsewhere.

Yet, it also objectifies living beings, together with other abiotic elements like rocks and minerals. It detaches them from their cultural values, and the political processes that shape landscapes, societies, and histories. The nature\/culture divide, for example, formed the cosmological basis of colonial plantation economies, which served as blueprints for industrial manufacturing in England and elsewhere. (9) In plantations and later in factories, slaves and sugarcane then machine parts and workers were easily interchangeable as&nbsp; commodities \u2013 that is, exchangeable at market rates. (10) Early capitalist developments were also accompanied by scientific advances in astronomy, mining, or metallurgy. (11)  The place of humankind in the world was transformed, as were those remaining worldviews that saw nature as a living, female, nurturing being. Nature became an inanimate, controllable object. (12) This anthropocentric view sanctions resource exploitation and is arguably the cultural foundation of the economic growth paradigm.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By speaking of resources or materials, ecological economists, and some degrowthers, therefore accept and mirror the mapping of capitalist exchange values onto the intrinsic and disparate values of the living world. Degrowth scholarship influenced by ecological economics puts forward evidence for postgrowth transformations regarding work, money, or wellbeing in the form of economic models, which are based on the abstraction of \u2018ecosystems\u2019 into mathematical representation. (13) Though paramount for guiding policy, these models sustain a mechanistic view of nature. This is problematic \u2013 and Eurocentric \u2013 because in doing so these models risk universalising a provincial, European\/North-Atlantic conceptualisation of nature \u2013 that is, nature-as-ecosystems, or even materials. This anthropocentrism in turn hampers possible alliances between degrowth and environmental justice movements from the Global South. In addition to degrowth\u2019s anthropocentrism, some of these movements have rejected degrowth as an ally because of its labour-market based perception of time, perceived to clash with indigenous and cyclical notions of time. (14)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response, a lot of work has been done by (activist-)scholars who aren\u2019t ecological economists to show that this narrow cultural framing isn\u2019t the only way of thinking, practicing, and approaching degrowth. In relation to degrowth, analyses of social property claims to trees in Brazil, the <em>khat <\/em>economy in Madagascar, <em>Ubuntu<\/em> in Southern Africa, <em>Buen Vivir<\/em> in Latin America, and environmental justice movements in Chiapas demonstrate that knowledge and ways of inhabiting the world are connected to territories as biophysical and political entities that are more than either \u2018just\u2019 nature, or \u2018just\u2019 culture. (15) Thereby, they show that it is possible to challenge anthropocentric, mechanistic conceptualisations of nature and attribute agency to the living world within the parameters of degrowth. These cultural analyses have undoubtedly broadened the tent of degrowth. Indeed, they show us how to overcome tendencies to reproduce anthropocentric nature\/culture binaries within degrowth. <em>Buen Vivir <\/em>is one such approach to cultural analyses, and in a dialogue between degrowth and <em>Buen Vivir<\/em> has the potential to create an ecology of knowledges. (16) Such conversation brings together different ways of knowing so that together, they may overcome their respective limitations and confront the intersecting challenges of the Anthropocene.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"791\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/price_of_doing_business-791x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9836\" srcset=\"https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/price_of_doing_business-791x1024.jpg 791w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/price_of_doing_business-232x300.jpg 232w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/price_of_doing_business-768x994.jpg 768w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/price_of_doing_business-1187x1536.jpg 1187w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/price_of_doing_business-585x757.jpg 585w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/price_of_doing_business-1170x1514.jpg 1170w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/price_of_doing_business-100x129.jpg 100w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/price_of_doing_business.jpg 1559w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 791px) 100vw, 791px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Buen Vivir<\/em> as a Grassroots, Decolonial Project<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Degrowth is one of the most convincing and holistic responses to the Anthropocene. However, its Eurocentric focus, expressed in, amongst others, forms of human-centric knowledge production, limits its place of relevance. It thereby also challenges only parts of the civilisationary patterns that have caused the multiple crises of the Anthropocene. Latin American thinkers have argued that we aren\u2019t just living in times of ecological crisis, but in multiple crises of modernity, defined by racism, sexism, classism, anthropocentrism, etc. (17) So why would an equitable dialogue between degrowth and <em>Buen Vivir<\/em>, an Andean-Amazonian conceptualisation of \u2018Good Living\u2019, create useful frameworks for a decolonial approach to degrowth? First, the violent politics of extractivism that confront a good or in fact any life in the Andes, disclose what is at stake for people living on the extractive frontiers from which raw materials are obtained. Andean and Amazonian communities have everything to gain from degrowth in the North. Second, other ways of engaging with the natural, or living, world and with \u2018others\u2019 in our society show up the limitations of our own, dichotomous thinking when it comes to nature vs. culture, the insider-outsider logic of the nation state, etc. This process also requires us to recognise that scientific, peer-reviewed knowledge alone won\u2019t be able to tackle the Anthropocene\u2019s multiple crises. Third, it situates degrowth in relation to other responses to these intersecting crises. Connecting with decolonial struggles will allow us to design transformation strategies with tools and concepts that are fundamentally different than the ones that have led to these crises in the first place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>B<em>uen Vivir<\/em> is a grassroots, decolonial project of the Ecuadorian indigenous movements.<em> Buen Vivir<\/em>, or Good Living, is Spanish for the Kichwa terms of <em>sumak kawsay<\/em> or <em>alli kawsay<\/em>. <em>Sumak kawsay<\/em> is a concept that has its origins in the indigenous world. Though this is contested by some, we have textual evidence of its use as a pedagogical principle from the beginning of the 20<sup>th<\/sup> century. (18) It translates into \u2018life in excellence\u2019 or \u2018life in plenitude\u2019. Today, it has become an umbrella term for a broad range of practices, imageries, and ideals of marginalised and racialised communities for working towards establishing equilibria with oneself, one\u2019s community, and nature. (19) The concept took on this broader meaning during the 1980s and 1990s, in which multiculturalism strengthened the indigenous movements. <em>Sumak kawsay <\/em>as a way of life configures close relations with land, within families and the spirits of ancestors, forests, water, and hills that are central to Kichwa identities, cultures, and thinking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Politically, the concept was consolidated via interaction with development organisations and left-wing intellectuals during the 1990s and early 2000s, a process that culminated in the constitutionalisation of <em>sumak kawsay <\/em>as <em>Buen Vivir<\/em>, or the right to Good Living in the 2008 Ecuadorian constitution. (20) By granting rights to nature, the constitution challenges nature\u2019s subordination to economic activity. However, this success was swiftly followed by a co-optation of the concept, which coincided with the loss of political power of the indigenous movements during the governments of Rafael Correa (2007\u201317). The political oppression of social, indigenous, and environmental movements took place under the guise of a discourse of <em>Buen Vivir<\/em> that justified extraction-led, growth-based development. (21) Nevertheless, today <em>sumak kawsay <\/em>continues to be a political platform for the indigenous movements of Ecuador towards territorial self-governance, equality, plurinationality, and wealth redistribution. (22)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what does <em>sumak kawsay<\/em> mean in practice? The literature about this is sparse, so I went to Ecuador to find out. For the purpose of this article, I will zoom in on some of the world-making practices that I observed, in other words, patterns and behaviours that create ways of inhabiting and viewing the world in which human, natural, and spiritual wellbeing is connected. Amongst others, <em>sumak kawsay<\/em> can be found in the recovery of ancestral seeds, such as quinoa and amaranth, in agroecological farming practices, as well as in the rituals, traditions, and garments of the indigenous peoples of Ecuador. Some of those patterns and behaviours I observed took place while I sat talking over a fire with a community\u2019s wisewoman. We rubbed our hands with an ointment made of plants and herbs that were grown using ancestral, agroecological farming practices. This simple act reminded us of our connection with nature. Another ritual I observed was the spilling of small amounts of alcoholic drinks, such as <em>chicha<\/em>, the typically fermented beverage made from maize or quinoa, on the ground before the drinker had any themselves. It is an offering to <em>Pachamama<\/em>, or Mother Earth, and recalls her presence. An act of reciprocity, it serves to sustain caring, affectionate, and mutualistic relationships between people and nature. Though the practitioners of these rituals were from agricultural communities, there is more than a utilitarian aspect to these rituals and agroecological farming practices. In Ecuador, agroecological production is not the norm, and can be met with considerable resistance from within or outside communities. Nevertheless, for practitioners like the Sumak Mikuna (\u201cExcellent Food\u201d) co-operative in El Tambo, located in the Southern Ca\u00f1ar province, the health of their children as well as topsoil fertility are dependent on the cultivation of a broad variety of high-quality organic produce. (23) Rather than neoclassical economic concerns such as profit margins, it is the underlying worldview, or cosmology, that animates these rituals, and which, vice versa, is put into practice by these rituals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The experiences I came to know while in Ecuador made me think that the world-making practices of <em>sumak kawsay<\/em>, observed in various communities in Ecuador, articulate \u2018<em>cosmological<\/em> limits to (development-as-)growth\u2019. Though the communities where I\u2019ve observed these practices don\u2019t struggle against the same extent of unrestrained growth and over-consumption as communities in the Global North, there is an understanding of the need to limit ecologically and socially harmful practices, such as the application of chemical fertilisers, or the construction of luxury houses by migrant returnees from the US or Spain. The practices I described above have the potential to limit socioeconomic activities before harmful social or ecological effects occur. Their respect guarantees the well-being of nature, which, in turn, produces material and spiritual wellbeing in its people. (24) In these contexts, Pachamama doesn\u2019t merely have a symbolic meaning. Instead, she is a living presence who can act as regulatory restraint to resource extraction and\/or environmental degradation. \u2018Cosmological limits to growth\u2019 therefore refers to limits set by worldviews \u2013 and their accompanying practices \u2013 that embed humankind within the living world, rather than considering humans as the masters of a controllable, inert nature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The argument I make here complements recent \u2018limits\u2019 debates within degrowth, ecological economics, and political ecology. They critically interrogate the mainstream environmental view of \u2018limits\u2019 as <em>external<\/em> \u2013 that is, physical and absolute borders, as epitomised in the famous, albeit depoliticised, image of \u2018planetary boundaries\u2019. It has been argued that, in and of itself, these limits, while having great potential to guide policy, do not contain unfettered growth. Given the lack of political progress in addressing the climate crisis, some highlight the possibility of prioritising morally constructed, <em>internal <\/em>limits that would restrain excess in autonomous societies<em>.<\/em> (25) Others have argued for <em>societal<\/em> self-limitation, where thresholds are defined collectively to contain both inequality and ecological destruction. (26)  Intersectional feminist and decolonial thinkers also stress the political nature or <em>artificiality <\/em>of scarcity that motivates some \u2018limits\u2019 scholarship and which justifies uneven resource access along gender, race, and class. (27)  They also draw attention to how different actors experience and understand limits and scarcity, and warn against a totalising conception of limits as ecological thresholds that erase other ways of relating to the living world \u2013 such as the practice of <em>sumak kawsay<\/em>. The notion of \u2018cosmological limits to growth\u2019 avoids the simplistic bifurcation of limits as either \u2018real\u2019 or \u2018constructed\u2019, and contains within it a possible pluriverse of worlds and knowledges without erasing one or the other. As such, \u2018cosmological limits to growth\u2019 are relational limits that arise out of our connection with each other and to the living world. They are normative constraints to the environmental destruction associated with economic growth. At the same time, they can create political instruments, such as Rights of Nature, that have the potential to change our view of nature as dead, inert matter, towards the environment as a living world. The conclusion will briefly elaborate on what impetus this notion can give to the cultural direction of socioecological transformations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"791\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/peril-791x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9837\" srcset=\"https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/peril-791x1024.jpg 791w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/peril-232x300.jpg 232w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/peril-768x994.jpg 768w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/peril-1187x1536.jpg 1187w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/peril-1583x2048.jpg 1583w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/peril-585x757.jpg 585w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/peril-1170x1514.jpg 1170w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/peril-100x129.jpg 100w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/peril-scaled.jpg 1978w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 791px) 100vw, 791px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cosmological Limits to Growth in Action: On Cultural (and Political) Directions of Socio-ecological Transformations<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Politically, \u2018cosmological limits to growth\u2019 can be put into practice through Rights of Nature (RoN). Environmental personhood is becoming an increasingly popular policy instrument to safeguard against environmental exploitation. In the social sciences, it can challenge the nature\/culture divide prevalent in many theoretical approaches. Rights-bearers now include rivers, mountains, and national parks in India, Ecuador, Colombia, New Zealand, the US, and elsewhere. Some have criticised RoN for perpetuating categorical binaries that pit a nature that is \u2018out there\u2019 against society, and for problematic colonial categories of personhood. (28) RoN nevertheless open up possibilities for protecting, and even imputing onto it, ways of living that respect nature as a living being. They could transform our understanding of nature from an inert resource towards a rights-bearer with agency. As such, RoN are an interesting, <em>pluriverse<\/em> avenue that should be explored in degrowth policy proposals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of cultural direction, there is a wider point to make for degrowth thinkers and practitioners. Going back to my observations in Ecuador, one agroecological producer planted certain types of trees to attract certain types of birds. In general, she dotted her vegetable patches with trees throughout, so that, in her words, the birds would have to eat as well. There might be another reason too: while the birds eat the fruits, they might fertilise a vegetable or two along the way. This is, in effect, the argument that agroecologists make: integrating natural solutions improves yield in comparison to monocrop production. In that sense, the grower\u2019s relationship with nature doesn\u2019t limit growth per se, but rather, the kind of culturally and ecologically harmful growth that a monocrop culture would bring. This observation, however, illustrates how \u2018cosmological limits to growth\u2019 embed society into nature. They recognise that while all \u2018limits\u2019 are necessarily socially constructed and physically present, it is this embeddedness that constrains harmful growth. \u2018Cosmological limits to growth\u2019 are intrinsic to worldviews based on connectedness with nature, and also found in pre-capitalist European cosmology. (29) They are antithetical to the nature\/culture divide within some degrowth scholarship, which has been criticised as anthropo- and Euro-centric.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To really change the systems destroying the world, we need to fundamentally revisit our relationship with nature, and dismantle the nature\/culture divide that justifies the treatment of the Earth as a resource. We need <em>cosmological<\/em> limits to growth because they steer the discussion beyond socioeconomic transformations to the more active, <em>cultural<\/em> direction of degrowth processes. To change the way we see nature, and, eventually, act towards it, is a fundamental condition for constraining harmful growth. If we consider ourselves part of nature and practice reciprocal behaviours, then we can eventually reinscribe cosmological limits to growth. However, changing the way we <em>think <\/em>and <em>feel<\/em> (\u201c<em>sentipensar<\/em>\u201d) requires a cultural transformation of a magnitude that has not yet been acknowledged by degrowth scholarship.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notes<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(1) &nbsp;Bengi Akbulut, \u2018Degrowth\u2019, <em>Rethinking Marxism<\/em> 33, no. 1 (2 January 2021): 98\u2013110, https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1080\/08935696.2020.1847014; Serge Latouche, \u2018Essays on Frugal Abundance.
