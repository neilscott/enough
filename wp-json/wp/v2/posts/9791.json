A 10-week programme, delivered as a partnership between Enough! Scotland and the Centre for Human Ecology, including a 4 night residential learning retreat and field trip at the Ceilidh Place in Ullapool in the Scottish Highlands.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>In times marked by an accelerating climate crisis, we explore together what degrowth could look like in Scotland, through a framing of human ecology and systems thinking. We understand \u2018degrowth\u2019 as meaning intergenerational social, ecological and migrant justice through decolonisation and equity within planetary limits \u2013 and this includes growth of socially and ecologically beneficial activity. The aim of this course is to create ripples to embed principles and practices of degrowth and human ecology among community and climate activists across Scotland. The course consists of a weekly online session with a talk followed by discussion, as well as readings for self-directed study. A key component of the course is to co-create a community of practice and peer-learning , which will be supported through a series of online peer group meetings and an in-depth 3.5-day (4 nights) residential in Ullapool. We draw upon methods taken from popular education and anti-oppression practices, peer-coaching and practical and immersive exercises.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The course takes place in the 50th anniversary year of the founding of the Centre for Human Ecology and the publication of Limits to Growth. We look forward to forming a learning community with you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Course format:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>8 online sessions:<\/strong> Each session will consist of a presentation on key themes in degrowth and human ecology, followed by a facilitated group discussion and break-out groups to digest the material.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Peer group meetings:<\/strong> There will be three additional online peer group meetings at times to be agreed by each group, and time dedicated to peer groups at the residential, in person.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Contributors: <\/strong>Bronagh Gallagher, <a href=\"https:\/\/degrowth.org\/lorenzo-velotti\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Lorenzo Velotti<\/a>, Luke Devlin, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mairimcfadyen.scot\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dr Mairi McFadyen<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rolandplayle.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Roland Playle<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.che.ac.uk\/people\/svenja-meyerricks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr Svenja Meyerricks<\/a>, with others to be announced<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Who is the course for? <\/strong>A key aim of the course is to develop the knowledge and capability of degrowth and human ecology principles among community and climate activists in Scotland.
