Stories of drifting sand dunes, witches\u2019 curses, environmental disaster and card games with the devil.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The focus of my research is on gaining an understanding of the human activity that contributed to these environmental catastrophes, with a view to developing new ideas and expanding concepts that will inform a body of climatologically engaged work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to find out more about how people explained these events and changes in the climate and landscape over time and how a desire to find explanations and meaning often led to rumours pointing to accusations of curses by witches or the devil.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having grown up around these places I am interested in how these have become the prevailing stories we remember locally; histories that are inextricably connected to the landscape as it has shifted and been reformed by natural forces and human hands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During this project I am also continuing to explore and experiment with approaches to making prints, developing on from work made for previous residencies and exhibitions inspired by the environment, climate, materials and process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am making sketches and audio and visual recordings from these places, keeping a record of the project while engaging with local residents and historians to deliver workshops and discussions; all of which will inform my research and development of new artworks.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>JAMIE TEMPLE Jamie is an artist-printmaker and educator whose practice is rooted in printmaking and woodworking from which he creates architectural and landscape inspired works on paper and site specific installations.
