Afterwards, it\u2019s even worse. Buyers fleeing urban environments for an \u2018improved quality of life\u2019 have created a particularly overheated property market in the Highlands and Islands. Rural areas already suffering from depopulation and chronic housing shortages for locals, especially young people, are at risk of becoming even more stratified. An underground network of rebel DIY housebuilders and campaigners are fighting back, finding ways to move through the cracks of a broken system to build the foundations for housing and land for all. LESS spoke to one of them, musician and strawbale self-build advocate Craig Bryce (Brycey) about life and work on the offgrid home he shares with his family at Cannich, in a woodland clearing overlooking Glen Affric. Brycey also shares his poetical reflections on COP26.

What did you learn from DIY underground culture that helped you in that journey<\/strong><strong>,<\/strong><strong> and what lessons can you take from that kind of non-hierarchical organising in order to find these opportunities within this really dominating environment?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brycey (B): We became exposed to the European squat scene and the idea that you can just set up whatever you need for yourself. It obviously needed you to have a physical space for that, and that just didn\u2019t seem possible in a flat in Glasgow. Sitting in Glasgow in our early-20s we were going, \u2018Right, in order to actually make that happen you have to live on the land and with the land.\u2019 So myself and Angus [Quinn, vocalist of Brycey\u2019s hardcore punk band, Sedition] moved to the Highlands way back then, and had a wee go at it. I ended up at the intentional community of Talamh. That was the thing that felt for me that we\u2019ve got a physical space, we\u2019ve got a foothold, and we\u2019ve got collectivisation which allows us to have a way together bigger than our own individual resources.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I then realised that people with no assets, if they collectivised could buy an 18th century farmhouse and 16 acres of land. We made that happen, and then we realised that we could also tap into different things by getting funding, by being in different organisations and learning in so many different ways. So we could identify a skills gap at Talamh and then try and find some way of getting someone trained to do it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That just felt like an extension of the DIY underground squat thing where you would just take a building and you would just look after yourself. The one that really sticks out was The Wohlgroth in Switzerland; it had everything from a women\u2019s refuge to a clothes shop to a metal workshop, a wood workshop, a microbrewery.&nbsp;It had everything, right in the centre of Z\u00fcrich, it was unbelievable. Completely blew me away that you could just get a bunch of people organising like that. So Talamh was a bit like a university for me in terms of giving me the idea that you can do that outwith the squat scene and within the landownership situation that happens within the UK. You can kind of circumvent it, through the power of collectivism.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I went down the career route of getting into doing outdoor education. Both my partner and I worked for a charity called Venture Trust out in Applecross, so we were living and working there, basically helping young offenders figure out how to get out of the court system and sort their lives out by taking them out on ten day expeditions and creating your own wee tribe, creating new value systems and helping people look at their lives differently. That helped us because we didn&#8217;t need to have a house, because there was tied housing or a caravan that you could stay in, so we were able to just save all our money. That meant we could start looking for land somewhere.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We didn&#8217;t want to end up with loads of debt or a mortgage, so that meant we needed to do it ourselves as much as possible and with the help of other people. So far, the whole build\u2019s been done, apart from digging out the foundations, by myself and [my partner] Ele or friends and family and volunteers. We did get a company called Straw Works to come in, pioneers in straw bale housebuilding in the UK. They put the car tyre foundations in, the straw-bale walls, all the key skill bits like that, and ran those as courses with volunteers who wanted to learn that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the other bits, we\u2019ve just watched Youtube videos! And asked for help from other people, and you really quickly tap into another community up here because it\u2019s normal for folk to build their own houses, it\u2019s not an unusual thing. You talk to the woman in the shop and she says, \u2018Aye, I\u2019ve built two,\u2019 and it\u2019s not a big deal at all, it\u2019s dead normal. You meet someone and they\u2019ll say, \u2018Yeah, I grew up in a caravan until I was eight because my parents were building our house,\u2019 and all that. It&#8217;s just a thing that happens here. And when at key points you need something, like you\u2019ve got to do an Amish barn-raising or something, 15 people will turn up who have all built their own houses and understand what it feels like to be in that position and they\u2019ll come and help you do that. You might be from very different walks of life and have different ideas politically, but it\u2019s like, \u2018No, we know about that, we\u2019re going to come help you do that bit of your house.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With our neighbours, we\u2019re co-operating on getting the water and services set up, and we\u2019ve made the decision to stay off-grid. We\u2019ll probably end up with a micro-hydro and a mixture of wind and solar for the site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve lived off-grid basically for eight years here. So we were feeling smug when there was a power cut down in the village! We were at my dad\u2019s the other night and all the lights went out and my wee boy Oran\u2019s like, \u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s a power cut, son.\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s a power cut?\u2019 He couldn\u2019t even understand the concept \u2018cause we\u2019re harvesting our own energy where we are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"313\" src=\"https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Screenshot-from-2021-11-19-16-09-00.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9644\" srcset=\"https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Screenshot-from-2021-11-19-16-09-00.png 768w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Screenshot-from-2021-11-19-16-09-00-300x122.png 300w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Screenshot-from-2021-11-19-16-09-00-585x238.png 585w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Screenshot-from-2021-11-19-16-09-00-100x41.png 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>LD: In terms of the build and the skills and resources that were needed, what was your starting point in terms of construction knowledge?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>B: Yeah we knew absolutely fuck all about any of it man! Ele\u2019s quite a voracious reader, she\u2019ll research anything she wants to get into, so she did a whole design that was like a frame with straw bale infill. And then there was a course out in Elgin that the Straw Works people ran and [Ele] became really inspired. It\u2019s a load-bearing straw&nbsp;bale build, so the walls are actually held up by the bales, so there\u2019s quite minimal carpentry in it and it\u2019s quite basic. So it feels quite accessible and achievable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s been lots of bits of it so far where we\u2019ve been like, \u2018What are we doing?!\u2019 But again, we\u2019ve got a friend who\u2019s been a really good help to us and has done more traditional buildings before and was like, \u2018I\u2019ll come help you put your roof truss in\u2019, and it\u2019s just been like, \u2018Oh yeah, that guy knows that, I\u2019ve got a mate that knows this,\u2019 and then just researching it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you were a roofer you\u2019d look at our roof and go, \u2018Aye that\u2019s a bit shonky,\u2019 and if you were a carpenter you\u2019d look at our verandas and go, \u2018Urgh.\u2019 But we\u2019re not bothered about that because it\u2019s felt really empowering to do it ourselves, it\u2019s felt like quite a primal thing to create our own home. I think the only way we\u2019ve been able to access stuff like that\u2019s maybe been through things like up at Carbeth to build a hut up there, and there\u2019s a community to help you. Whereas when you get into this kind of sustainable self-build, it just feels right \u2013 part of what we should be doing as a human being.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re on year three of it, but that\u2019s because we\u2019re trying to do it without a mortgage, so we\u2019re not employing any tradespeople to come in because a) we can\u2019t afford to, and b) we don\u2019t really want to until we really need to. If it\u2019s got to be signed off, like electrics, then we\u2019ll have to do that, but we\u2019re trying to do everything ourselves, and for that to be part of the whole thing. Which means it takes a lot longer, and it\u2019s a bit frustrating.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we\u2019ve already helped other people, we\u2019ve met other straw-bale folk that have started on that journey and we\u2019ve been able to go and mentor them a wee bit and give them what they need \u2013 there\u2019s a kind of reciprocity to it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"773\" height=\"526\" src=\"https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Screenshot-from-2021-11-19-16-09-111.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9645\" srcset=\"https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Screenshot-from-2021-11-19-16-09-111.png 773w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Screenshot-from-2021-11-19-16-09-111-300x204.png 300w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Screenshot-from-2021-11-19-16-09-111-768x523.png 768w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Screenshot-from-2021-11-19-16-09-111-585x398.png 585w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Screenshot-from-2021-11-19-16-09-111-100x68.png 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 773px) 100vw, 773px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>L<\/strong><strong>D<\/strong><strong>: <\/strong><strong>What more support should there be for people that are wanting to do that?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>B: There are a lot of people just doing it! And obviously they don\u2019t want to publicise it. There are people all over the Highlands that are like, \u2018Right, I\u2019m putting something in there and I\u2019ll wait to see if they find me.\u2019 And there are ways of doing it where you might be like, \u2018Right, my build is like a forester\u2019s hut where I stay when I\u2019m working in the woods,\u2019 and then eventually it gets a change of use on it. All these things are underground and DIY, and I think the Thousand Huts campaign from Reforesting Scotland is feeding into that, there\u2019s a lot of skills going round that, even though the flipside of that is there\u2019s a lot of people with loads of money that are turning it into a strictly middle class or upper class pursuit almost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some folk do manage to blog it and use it as training opportunities and things like that. I don\u2019t have space to do that, I\u2019m barely able to be involved in anything else other than building the house, looking after my family, and doing the work I need to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It needs to be broken down for people to really repopulate and be here and live and work on the land in a way that\u2019s beneficial and supports a lot of folk and reverses the rural depopulation trend. The Airbnb thing\u2019s only made it worse. Young folk just cannae get a hoose. It\u2019s not new to the Highlands, but it\u2019s intensifying more and more. You add COVID into that and everyone leaving the cities to come to their \u2018rural idyll\u2019; and the carbon credits, Brewdog creating a fucking forest to pretend they\u2019re carbon neutral. There\u2019s a lot of pressure that makes landownership even more tricky to get to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>LD: There is a challenging element to the commitment you\u2019ve made that tests you to a certain extent, and forces you to maybe become more resilient and increase your capability in terms of exposure to taking care of your fundamental ne<\/strong><strong>eds in a way that isn\u2019t about just buying a product or buying a service, because you have to do it yourself. What have been the main lessons you have learned about what really matters in life, and what are the most important things about human flourishing?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>B: The things that on the surface other folk would be like, \u2018Woah, are you mad?,\u2019 like having to go and smash the pond with a sledgehammer to get water out of it because everything is frozen solid in the middle of the winter or whatever. We could have better systems in place that would mean we wouldn\u2019t have to do that, that\u2019s the thing, problem solving. You can\u2019t buy a product to do that because you\u2019re like, \u2018Right, so we need to get water from a pond all the way up the hill to come down to our caravan somehow.\u2019 So you\u2019ve got to problem-solve everything that way. And that, again, feels really empowering. Then when you\u2019ve got your roasting hot, pummeling 12 volt shower and you\u2019re like, \u2018Yes, we did it!\u2019 Now it\u2019s broken, so I\u2019m not boasting that much! But all those systems that we had to figure out at first, it\u2019s just a total learning journey that makes you feel a sense of self-worth that wouldn\u2019t happen if you were just buying a product to solve those problems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re really lucky&nbsp;\u2013 the elements here, when it\u2019s windy, you know it\u2019s windy; when it\u2019s cold, you know it\u2019s cold. When we actually get the build finished and move in, we\u2019re moving ourselves slightly away from that to a different level of comfort that\u2019s going to feel really strange because we\u2019ve lived like this for eight years now. And when it gets to the deep winter this year and it\u2019s -10\u00b0C again, and the whole site you can\u2019t drive a vehicle onto for maybe four months, and there\u2019s ice on the inside of the bedroom windows, there\u2019s points where you\u2019re like, \u2018Urgh.\u2019 But there\u2019s points where you do need to just dig a little deeper. And just that kind of slight life-threatening adversity brings something else out of you as a human being. And we do use technology. We watch films, we\u2019re chatting on Zoom now, we sit and play music, we do other things&nbsp;\u2013 it\u2019s not as if we\u2019re sitting here carving spoons all night with a candle on. But it is different from living in a city with technology surrounding you as a thing that you just turn to all the time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You just naturally spend more time in awe of nature. You\u2019ve got to get your wood to bring down for the burner and you\u2019re looking at the view, or you see a red kite flying above you. You just feel a connection that you don\u2019t get unless you\u2019re living a bit closer to the land like this. And I think that moves also to having a spiritual connection, a feeling much more of belonging to where you are. I\u2019ve bought a bit of land but I don\u2019t really believe in landownership, but I did it because I didn\u2019t want anyone to be able to take the housing that I have away from me and I wanted to be empowered by that. Also observing the Celtic calendar and all that \u2013&nbsp;you\u2019re in that tradition, you\u2019re playing that music, you\u2019re hearing that language, you\u2019re hearing the wind and the rain and it\u2019s all part of what enriches your life. We feel really lucky. Especially when COVID happened, we couldn\u2019t be in a better place. We grow as much of our food as we can, we use an organic veg box, and I get most of the rest of my food from Highland Wholefoods. We rarely deal with supermarkets, we\u2019ve removed ourselves a little bit from that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the house; all the windows were bought second hand, as much as we can. We felled and milled all the wood on site here ourselves. Instead of going and buying the timber, you actually get your mates and chop the trees down and mill them yourself, and you just do that with everything. It\u2019s just part of how you try and operate. And it saves you a lot of money now as well, because the prices are insane. We\u2019ve got our wood out there for the rest of the build, and if we had to buy that now, we\u2019d not be able to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do feel more centred as a human being\u00a0\u2013 with my family on the land, doing what I\u2019m doing\u00a0\u2013 than I ever have in my life. And there\u2019s lots of reasons for that, but I think it is that thing of thinking, \u2018Right, I\u2019m putting my roots down here and this is a long term thing.\u2019 And it\u2019s not, \u2018Oh, then we can sell the house and move somewhere else and move up the ladder,\u2019 and all that. This is for Oran, when I\u2019m away this is Oran\u2019s house, and hopefully his family\u2019s place if that\u2019s what he wants. Once we\u2019ve moved on from the house being built, we\u2019ll try and get a self-sustaining ecosystem here which is also inclusive for people to come and enjoy. I wouldn\u2019t rule out us trying to get involved in helping people access this kind of thing in a more formal way once we have finished everything, because it\u2019s important to me to not just be like, \u2018We\u2019re sorted now,\u2019 and then sit back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"621\" height=\"879\" src=\"https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Screenshot-from-2021-11-19-16-08-26.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9646\" srcset=\"https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Screenshot-from-2021-11-19-16-08-26.png 621w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Screenshot-from-2021-11-19-16-08-26-212x300.png 212w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Screenshot-from-2021-11-19-16-08-26-585x828.png 585w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Screenshot-from-2021-11-19-16-08-26-100x142.png 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>L<\/strong><strong>D<\/strong><strong>: <\/strong><strong>What are your thoughts on sharing that learning about relationship and reciprocity that you mentioned with <\/strong><strong>folk that are living in cities who either are not going to have the opportunity to do it or maybe don\u2019t want to? Many want to live in a city, or have to, but how people live in cities has to change drastically as well.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>B: It\u2019s as simple as collective organisation&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;something like GAS [Glasgow Autonomous Space] being there now, or even the Kinning Park Complex and the way that operates.&nbsp;There\u2019s lots of small scale things like that already happening, and they are all actually there, it\u2019s just that you don\u2019t hear about it. I think it will scale up, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to drop away suddenly. Going back to COP26 and the bigger picture of it, like Greta Thunberg is saying, the way capitalists are going to \u2018fix\u2019 climate change, capitalism and climate change are interlinked \u2013 the thing we keep coming up against is land and property ownership. I don\u2019t mean just demonstrations, but just linking up as communities and creating these autonomous spaces as well, and then networks will just keep growing. Because people are realising that the people in power are not doing it and are not going to do it. Mutual aid basically, anarchism. Who are the people stepping up and getting things done at the refugee camps? It\u2019s not the authorities. It\u2019s mutual aid. It\u2019s that spirit that underpins everything.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It needs more direct action activism, but what Talamh and the Pollok Free State really taught me is that you can\u2019t spend all your energy going against what you don\u2019t like as it leaves very little to create what you do like. I think that\u2019s tipped over a bit now and loads of people are building what they do like, and seeing those networks, just small groups and collectives of people who are working together \u2013 that\u2019s the only way I can kind of see this knowledge spreading out without getting greenwashed or co-opted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do worry that it\u2019s too slow \u2013&nbsp;because the power of what it\u2019s up against in terms of resurgent fascism and climate change, and the way that the powers that be seem to be able to just manipulate the media narrative. My only way of staying sane against that is to actually just link up with people and go and do what you want to happen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And whether that\u2019s being at COP and having the demonstrations and all the rest of it, or creating a food garden in your local area and teaching people how to grow in an urban setting. And making sure places don\u2019t get gentrified and developed, there\u2019s green space, cycle routes, all these little victories. You can\u2019t expect these powers that be to change because they rely so heavily on the profit motive, they don\u2019t seem to understand that GDP shouldn\u2019t be all we focus on. It\u2019s starting to happen, but it needs to happen now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our society is fragile and vulnerable because we\u2019ve been deskilled so much in that way, we just phone someone these days, you don\u2019t do it yourself. Things like tool libraries and being able to actually share that expertise is key. I\u2019m not being totally prepper about it, but industrial society is not going to be able to keep going the way it is, so you need a different set of skills to transition through that. And that includes the ability to be able to organise co-operatively and interact with each other that doesn\u2019t involve hierarchies and coercion. And that\u2019s such a valuable skill that we\u2019re really going to need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a movement to become something bigger and stronger, it has to involve the people in the schemes as well. I remember there was a group called the Milton Class War Casuals and they were mad techno heads, but they looked like a bunch of mad neds that just went out clubbing, but they were switched on politically. If you had all the schemes like that, the power that is sitting in those communities if they were plugged into all these things as well.
