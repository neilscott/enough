Born in India, she grew up in Vancouver, Canada, and has been living in Scotland for most of her adult life. She is widely published and has collaborated across various art forms, including stage and film. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was George Mackay Brown Writing Fellow in Orkney from 2009 until 2010, where she worked with dancers, musicians, visual artists, archaeologists and the RSPB. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her first poetry pamphlet,&nbsp;Skirlags, was shortlisted for the Callum Macdonald Award in 2010. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her collection, The Raven\u2019s Song (2015) is inspired by raven and crow myths from Orkney, Shetland and Canada. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nalini\u2019s poetic work for stage with Stellar Quines Theatre Company, Beyond the Mud Walls, is set partly in 1940s India and was showcased for \u2018Rehearsal Rooms\u2019 at the Traverse, Edinburgh, in September 2016. She was a Robert Louis Stevenson Fellow in 2017, spending a month at Grez-sur-Loing, France working on her poetry partly inspired by The Bhagavad Gita. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nalini undertook a residency in Lewis and Kolkata as part of the \u2018New Passages\u2019 project (2017-18), exploring connections between India and Scotland.

Was there a hierarchy of language, which enabled power over individuals\/groups? Was there a form of subversion against this domination? (If this is before written language, we can never \u2018know\u2019, but we can imagine.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The framework may be based on oral histories\/stories, myths, etc (as opposed to \u2018history\u2019).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The research could look to include myths and stories connected to wells in Pictish Scotland (the one in Burghead may have been used for ritual drownings). I will look for connections between these stories and the raven and crow myths which I have explored in my poetry collection, The Raven\u2019s Song (2015), in terms of transformation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>I am currently working on an extended piece of fiction (which may include poetry at some stage), exploring the loss of language and literacy, communication, landscape, memory and belonging. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through metaphor, it aims to subvert existing hierarchies and narratives (of coloniser over colonised subject) by giving voice to the voiceless female protagonist. The landscape (both imagined and lived\/real) forms an integral part of the character\u2019s identity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By focussing on specific physical details of that landscape, one is reminded of the loss of natural spaces (both micro and macro); and I wish to explore the individual\u2019s connection to \u2018natural\u2019 landscapes through sensory perceptions and materiality. The physical nature of the landscape (and potentially its \u2018thingness\u2019) gives life to the character, echoing the fragility and complexity of the individual and her natural environment.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>NALINI PAUL Nalini Paul\u2019s poetry is inspired by natural landscapes, walks and memory.
