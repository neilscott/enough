Where vast and\nintricate forests have been grubbed, and serried lines of obedient\nplantations are kept going by the poisoning that preserves and\npollutes them. A poison that no longer runs in, but works its way\nthrough, taunting any possibility of a future. \n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All\nhope in our techno-future died where pixels of virtual connection and\ncurrents of promised power-for-nothing electricity breathed their\nlast, burnt their last, leaving that future in the past.\nTechno-desolation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Out\nhere in the darkness after the great burning.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\nare stars again.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\nis a growing edge of birdsong where there was only motor roar.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My\nheart beat can be heard again. \n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The\nfour walled prison screen is broken, and through the down whole I can\nsee ridges of chimneyed rooftops, distant hills, crashing waves,\nthundering clouds, galaxies tail-flicking stars in the night. \n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The\nhorizon rushes in to meet us, wanting to dance. \n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\nhad thought the future was far off, hurtling towards us, unknown. We\nhad thought the future rushes past us in an instant, turns to solid\nchunks of unalterable past.
