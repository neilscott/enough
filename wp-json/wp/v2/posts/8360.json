This conversation will examine the importance of narratives that don\u2019t perpetuate the dominant, capitalist, post-colonialist worldview, looking at examples of helpful and damaging resources available and sharing ideas of how to use your existing materials to promote critical analysis in children of all ages. Brought to you with humility and an understanding that working towards decolonised parenting is not a linear progression, that we are all learning all the time and how much we can learn from each other.<br><br>Sapna Agarwal is community activist, parent and long-term home educator. She is the founding member of Glasgow\u2019s longest running home education group, a non-hierarchical, all ages, social group based on mutual respect and support. She is also a partner at Aye-Aye Books, a radical bookshop based in the CCA, Glasgow. She initiated the children\u2019s section there which stocks books featuring children under-represented on the high street and in mainstream media. <br> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Kuwanda Huuya, with Tawona Sithol\u00e9<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thursday 18th June<\/strong>,<strong> 7pm &#8211; 8:30pm<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Kuwanda Huuya, with Tawona Sithol\u00e9\" width=\"1170\" height=\"658\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/YefkZ7UPx70?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Tawona-Sithole-024-731x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8473\" width=\"228\" height=\"319\" srcset=\"https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Tawona-Sithole-024-731x1024.jpg 731w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Tawona-Sithole-024-214x300.jpg 214w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Tawona-Sithole-024-768x1075.jpg 768w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Tawona-Sithole-024-585x819.jpg 585w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Tawona-Sithole-024-1170x1638.jpg 1170w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Tawona-Sithole-024-100x140.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 228px) 100vw, 228px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>The idiom kuwanda huuya from ancient people of what is now called Zimbabwe is a sense of living that acknowledges the collective as the unit of society, not the individual as our contemporary life suggests.

They are also internalised within us to such a degree that they affect our capacity to live our values and commitments. In this informal conversation Miki Kashtan addresses challenging questions related to our internalised powerlessness, habits of scarcity and separation, and systemic limitations to support us in finding practices and reflections to anchor new ways of functioning. Agreements and inner work can then combine to make robust structures of support to increase our alignment and effectiveness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Miki Kashtan is a practical visionary pursuing a world that works for all, based on principles and practices rooted in feminist nonviolence.
