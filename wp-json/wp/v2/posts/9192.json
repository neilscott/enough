The concept of a \u2018just transition\u2019,used by climate justice campaigns in relation to the pandemic and its aftermath, is useful when considering ways forward to restore and reconfigure people\u2019s livelihoods by redistributing work and shifting industries towards those compatible with ecological restoration and zero carbon practices.
