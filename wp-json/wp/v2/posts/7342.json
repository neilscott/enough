The main reason?:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re transitioning rapidly to a radically different global economy, due to our increasingly unsustainable exploitation of the planet\u2019s environmental resources.<\/p>\n<p>Climate change and species extinctions are accelerating even as societies are experiencing rising inequality, unemployment, slow economic growth, rising debt levels, and impotent governments. Contrary to the way policymakers usually think about these problems, the new report says that these are not really separate crises at all.<\/p>\n<p>Rather, these crises are part of the same fundamental transition to a new era characterized by inefficient fossil fuel production and the escalating costs of climate change. Conventional capitalist economic thinking can no longer explain, predict, or solve the workings of the global economy in this new age, the paper says.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It may be mundane but the reality is that\u00a0Energy Return on Investment (EROI) \u2013 a simple ratio that measures how much energy we use to extract more energy \u2013 may be presenting the endgame for the fossil fuel economy that lies beneath western economics.<\/p>\n<p>The timeline between our diminishing finite fuel resources, and our inability to transition to a low-carbon economy has been a dance between political intransigence, consumer duplicity and corporate greenwashing.<\/p>\n<p>In a new book published by Pluto this month Simon Pirani explains the contradictions and roots of the crisis in\u00a0<a title=\"\" href=\"https:\/\/www.plutobooks.com\/blog\/truth-fight-against-fossil-fuels\/?preview=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?hl=en&amp;q=https:\/\/www.plutobooks.com\/blog\/truth-fight-against-fossil-fuels\/?preview%3Dtrue&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1536684762631000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGiTcrdYpRa3_MvX4_V7Sh33dC6ow\">\u201cThe Truth about the Fight Against Fossil Fuels\u201d:<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen politicians and diplomats meet in Katowice, Poland, in December for the 2018 round of international climate negotiations, they will not even pretend to aim at cutting greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 mostly from burning fossil fuels \u2013 far enough to prevent dangerous climate change.<br \/>\nThe negotiators\u2019 modest aim is to leave Katowice with an agreed procedure for monitoring implementation of promises that countries made to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions at the Paris climate conference in 2015.<\/p>\n<p>Even if all the governments involved keep all their promises (like that has ever happened!), we are heading by 2100 for global average temperatures 2.6 degrees above the pre-industrial level.
