Welcome to Glasgow. Welcome to Scotland. We are drawing on Glasgow\u2019s radical past to inject hope and urgency into the moribund COP process.<\/strong><br><br>YOUR VISION OF our country may be an idealised one of lochs brimming with salmon and glens filled with deer, but in reality we\u2019re a petro-chemical economy being held ransom by the British State. Our most famous icons and exports \u2013 our salmon and deer and grouse \u2013 are really symbols of a country disfigured by landed power. We remain a semi-feudal nation with one of the most unequal distributions of land ownership in the world. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Gaelic, Glasgow means \u2018Dear Green Place\u2019, but Glasgow was also known from the 19th century as the Second City of the Empire, a city that became synonymous with massive expansion, global trade, industry, invention, and shipbuilding. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For almost 200 years, the statue of the celebrated Scottish inventor and engineer James Watt has stood in George Square. Every schoolchild is taught about the invention of the steam engine in 1776, which was fundamental to the changes brought by the Industrial Revolution across the world. What\u2019s less well known is that Watt\u2019s father was a slave trader, a colonial merchant who subsidised his son. The development of the steam engine was funded by slavery. Watt himself was involved in colonial commerce and played a direct role in the trafficking of enslaved people. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Glasgow playing host to the COP in 2021, we have historical symmetry. It\u2019s more of a loop than a continuum; as the world faces climate catastrophe, the same city that was pivotal in the Industrial Revolution, colonisation, and Empire is the city that must now be the pivot towards decolonisation and degrowth. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mirroring the challenge facing humanity itself, the city of Glasgow needs to find ways to move beyond the old story that it has become defined by. This is not just about moving beyond an industrial legacy and identity; it\u2019s about moving beyond a history of violence and ongoing destruction. Like the abandoned coalfields that pockmark Fife and Ayrshire, the empty docks that still line the Clyde speak to communities left to mass unemployment and intergenerational trauma. For Glasgow, and for the rest of us, degrowth is about finding ways of living and being beyond our obsession with productivity and consumption and GDP. It\u2019s about working towards a radical&nbsp;transformation of our society to one which serves a new function: supporting the flourishing and sustaining of life. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The path towards this transformation or \u2018transition\u2019 is faint and hard to make out. Any movement of change left to market forces motivated by profits and constrained within the economics of globalisation \u2013 a political and economic ideology based on exploitative practices towards people, land, and nature \u2013 will follow the same inevitable path to destruction. After a year in the trauma of the pandemic, the climate crisis came to Europe. Extreme weather visited the Global North with an unrecognisable summer of flooding, wildfires, and extreme heat. Even the most complacent were woken from their slumbers to confront a present and future of climate emergency that can no longer be ignored. We are heading full steam into a world of fossil-fuel expansion and mass extinction of species, including our own. As the IPPC report stated, we are living in \u201ccode red for humanity: the alarm bells are deafening, and the evidence is irrefutable.\u201d <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, incredibly, the Prime Minister \u2013 of the UK government Scotland did not elect \u2013 is preparing to sign off on a new drilling permit at Cambo oilfield, west of Shetland.1 If approved, Cambo would produce 170m barrels of oil and would deepen the climate crisis for decades to come. [2] It is a staggeringly backward move, an exercise in futility and, ultimately, a crime against humanity. In Scotland, we don\u2019t have full democratic control over our future path, and in this situation there is an echo of the climate predicament. In a world where greenwash and disinformation dominate, it\u2019s easy to feel alienated and see only the futility of the process. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The COP26 Coalition joined calls for the summit\u2019s postponement, stating: <br><br><strong>\u201cAs the clock ticks on this crucial decade, rich countries must commit to doing their fair share of climate action, cutting emissions to zero and paying their carbon debt to the global South. This is the bare minimum needed to pave the way for a successful COP26, yet the COP Presidency is far from showing such leadership [&#8230;] From climate to Covid the UK has shown it is willing to sacrifice those worst off to shore up huge profits for the few.\u201d [3] <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The challenge is not to be consumed by the huge gravitational pull and distraction of COP \u2013 its hype, its false hope, its unreality, its greenwashed credentials and stage\u0002managed accords. The challenge is to organise within communities and resist the police state, to speak the truth, to cultivate outrage, to create a rupture, to challenge inevitability, and to imagine, articulate, and build different futures. Our humantiy and our home is under threat. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>BEING HUMAN <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>IF, AS THE IPCC stated: \u201cAll pathways begin now and involve rapid and unprecedented social transformation\u201d, then Glasgow has a radical political history to inspire the movement. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"955\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/1024-1098-955x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9522\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/1024-1098-955x1024.jpg 955w, https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/1024-1098-280x300.jpg 280w, https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/1024-1098-768x824.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/1024-1098-585x627.jpg 585w, https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/1024-1098-100x107.jpg 100w, https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/1024-1098.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 955px) 100vw, 955px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Glasgow is not just a city of Empire built on exploitation; it is also a city built on struggle. Whether it\u2019s Mary Barbour\u2019s rent strikes or John Maclean and Red Clydeside in the early 20th century, Jimmy Reid and the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders of 1971, the anti-\u0002Polaris and CND movement, the Anti-Poll Tax Campaign, the anti-apartheid movement, Pollok Free State in the 1990s, the Kenmure Street protest of 2021 or the countless unsung pockets of radical and inspired action in the communities that make up the fabric of the city, there is much to learn from Glasgow\u2019s radical past. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other sources of local inspiration include Jimmy Reid\u2019s Rectorial Address to the University of Glasgow in 1972, a speech that has had reverberations and resonance down the years. He could be speaking to us directly today: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\u201cLet me right at the outset define what I mean by alienation. It is the cry of men who feel themselves the victims of blind economic forces beyond their control. It is the frustration of ordinary people excluded from the processes of decision making. The feeling of despair and hopelessness that pervades people who feel with justification that they have no real say in shaping or determining their own destinies. [&#8230;] Reject these attitudes. Reject the values and false morality that underlie these attitudes. A rat race is for rats. We\u2019re not rats. We\u2019re human beings.\u201d <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the critique of the climate crisis turns on humanity; claiming, with the spectre of ecofascism looming, that \u201cWe humans are the problem.\u201d. The answer for Reid is not less humanity but less capitalism. The power structures that have emerged threaten and undermine our hard won democratic rights. His words echo down the ages: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\u201cGovernment by the people for the people becomes meaningless unless it includes major economic decision making by the people for the people. This is not simply an economic matter. In essence it is an ethical and moral question, for whoever decisions in society ipso facto determines the social priorities of that society.\u201d <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our global economy is structured so that disproportionate, dangerous, and unprecedented amounts of wealth and power are centralised and held by the people and multi-national corporations involved in excessive extractive industries driving climate breakdown and ecosystem collapse. They are taking decisions which are not in the interests of you, me, or the billions of people and diverse ecosystems on this planet. In degrowth, we have an opportunity to transfer power away from those bodies towards more democratic structures and processes that centre care and life\u0002sustaining work. We need to shift towards an economy away from growth-at-any\u0002cost to an economy that is feminist in the sense of the late Scottish economist Ailsa Mackay [4] and as outlined by Maria Mies [5] : <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\u201cThe feminist project is basically an anarchist movement which does not want to replace one (male) power elite by another (female) power elite, but which wants to build up a non-\u0002hierarchical, non-centralised society where no elite lives off exploitation and dominance over others.\u201d <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"989\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/1931-2000-max-989x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9523\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/1931-2000-max-989x1024.jpg 989w, https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/1931-2000-max-290x300.jpg 290w, https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/1931-2000-max-768x795.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/1931-2000-max-1483x1536.jpg 1483w, https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/1931-2000-max-585x606.jpg 585w, https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/1931-2000-max-1170x1212.jpg 1170w, https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/1931-2000-max-100x104.jpg 100w, https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/1931-2000-max.jpg 1931w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 989px) 100vw, 989px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We also need new mechanisms to sustainably \u2018govern the commons\u2019, as sketched out by Elinor Ostrom [6] \u2013 which include restoring our oceans and the atmosphere in service of the greater good.

Paul Routledge, Gehan Macleod, and David Lees write about the GalGael Free State as an autonomous zone near the \u2018blue zone\u2019 where climate talks are talking place. Luke Devlin interviews Craig Bryce about rebel DIY housebuilding and the autonomy that comes with building collectives. Rhyddian Knight interviews David Blair about the ark he built on the Cowal peninsula to highlight the plight of coastal communities. Peter Kitelo Chongeywo of the Ogiek Indigenous Forest Peoples of Mount Elgon, Kenya, sees climate change activism in the UK as fighting for all our tomorrows. Kate Chambers writes about the need to decouple social mobility from resource consumption. Mark Langdon reflects on education for transformation as a crucial tool in a time of ecological and social crisis. Svenja Meyerricks interviews climate justice activist Nomalizo Xhoma in Johannesburg about the COP and community struggles in South Africa. Catriona Spaven-Donn argues for commons food systems that are grounded in collaborative relationships between plants and fungi. And, finally, Vishwam Heckert reflects on the need to unlearn Empire and abstraction and disconnection by unlearning the embodied and psychic habit of separating \u2018us\u2019 and \u2018them\u2019 or \u2018me\u2019 from the \u2018world\u2019. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Dear Green Place is the perfect venue for COP, where all the contradictions and complexities of our past, present, and possible futures are laid bare. Glasgow is a site of both colonisation and decolonisation, imperialism and anti-imperialism. It is a city disfigured by poverty and scarred by violence, exploitation, and trauma. It is also a city of resistance, hospitality, political radicalism, and hope. From Glasgow, we need to forge a world where we are no longer \u201cthe victims of blind economic forces beyond our control.\u201d [7]&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The choice is endless growth of global capital or life on earth.
