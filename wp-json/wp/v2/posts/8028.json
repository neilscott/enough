The inner walls will be made from raw sheep wool from the Highlands \u2013 a valuable natural resource that is often burned with petrol as it wouldn\u2019t fetch enough money at market. I will also create a soundscape, including natural phenomena such as singing icebergs\/ whistling winds &amp; storms\/ water\/migrating birds\/and the bodies&#8217; own beats which the viewer will be able to hear in the chamber at quiet interludes. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want people to interact fully with this piece. To touch it, smell it, have their perception altered by it. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This soundscape will alternate with periods of profound silence generated within an echoic chamber. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If someone stays long enough in these soundless spaces, then they can start to hallucinate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps they will create their own internal film from everything their senses will absorb.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key thing that I wish to communicate with this piece is that everything is connected; what is within and without\u2026.the state of inhabiting and loss. My observation is that sometimes people forget that the world we live in, the landscape, our bodies and our senses are all connected. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our actions affect our environment and vice versa. It can be easy for people in relatively privileged positions to feel they aren\u2019t affected by something that happens hundreds of miles away, or that they will be safe. That all they have to complain about is hot summers, wetter colder winters and the rising cost of imported food.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be abstract qualities to this piece, although the film installation will allow for more specificity. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have two frustrations with dialogues around climate change that I wish to explore:<br>*the centralisation of white voices and concern for the wellbeing of western nation states<br> *that the blame is pinned on the consumer and not on capitalism.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deconstruction, re-connection and communication are key to change.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Nosheen Khwaja Nosheen is an artist, designer, tech and filmmaker given enough time.
