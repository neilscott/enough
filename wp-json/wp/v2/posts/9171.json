The focus is on collective and democratic solutions to sustaining livelihoods that meet people\u2019s needs while rising to the threats of climate change, ecocide and mass extinction, inequality, racism and the far right, and the interconnected oppressive and extractivist logic and mechanisms that feed all of those.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We invite a combination of thoroughly researched material, opinion pieces, poetry and art work.

Youth unrest ablaze in Northern Ireland as lockdown ennui meets marginalisation and predictable Brexit realpolitik. Mandatory, socially constructed royal mourning across the UK as hauntology meets hyperreal soft authoritarianism. Meanwhile, the most symbolic image from this period remains that of a gigantic stuck container ship blocking one of the world\u2019s most important trade arteries, laying bare the perverse fragility of our global supply chains. All this during a Scottish election cycle in which little of substance appears to be proposed in response to the metacrisis that threatens the basis of life.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A hostile environment that has been around long before Brexit was on the horizon seems to have permeated daily life for many of us. The real danger is when this state of exception seems to feel normal, and alternatives to seem fanciful. We need to imagine new worlds while we can.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is one of those strange twists of fate that almost at the exact point in time when Brexit \u2013 and blue passports \u2013 finally arrived, freedom of movement stopped almost completely for UK citizens, halted by a mutant virus strain, the impact of which was exacerbated by incompetent government handling of the pandemic.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we write this, we\u2019re past the vernal equinox and warmth and light are returning to Scotland, with the natural sense of hope this instills in the heart. Migratory birds and fish have left their winter haunts and arrived back at UK shores. Our annual reminder that freedom of movement is not just a perk that was temporarily bestowed upon us as a by-product of being a member state of a single market. Freedom of movement is the default mode of all life forms, us included \u2013 it\u2019s how evolution itself unfolded. Global freedom of movement is also a core demand of the degrowth movement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In LESS\u2019s first issue in 2021, we look at degrowth in the context of Brexit and the pandemic, and share some modest proposals to intervene and build new lifeways that are within our power.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the institutions and public sentiment of a degraded United Kingdom cultivate a protectionist and insular retreat from the world, it\u2019s more important than ever to build political solidarity, intellectual networks, and cultural connections across Europe. In that spirit, this issue of LESS has contributions from Joachim Spangenberg (Vice President, Sustainable Europe Research Institute and Chair of BUND\/Friends of the Earth Germany), a translation of work by Adri\u00e1n Almaz\u00e1n and Luis Gonz\u00e1lez Reyes (Between limit and desire: strategic directions in the collapse of industrial civilisation) and an interview with activist, author and academic Andrea Vetter on degrowth principles by Svenja Meyerricks.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"840\" src=\"https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/turtle-1024x840.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9166\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/turtle-1024x840.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/turtle-300x246.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/turtle-768x630.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/turtle-585x480.jpg 585w, https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/turtle-100x82.jpg 100w, https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/turtle.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a collaborative essay from the Highlands with contributions from Ainslie Roddick, C\u00e1it O&#8217;Neill McCullagh, Charlotte Mountford, Fadzai Mwakutuya, Jo Rodgers, Kirsten Body, Lauren Pyott, Lisa MacDonald, Mairi McFadyen, Philomena de Lima and Raghnaid Sandilands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are also delighted to publish Sarah Glynn on cohousing and ecology, Pat Kane imagining a spot-capitalist future, Alis Le May on slow-fashion and restoration of local craft skills and poetry on borders between the global north and global south from Juana Adcock.
