Written by Nigerian-born  story teller Atinuke, the stories follow a young child, Anna Hibiscus  on her adventures. Anna is part of a mixed race family living in  \u201camazing Africa\u201d. The same author has written amonther series called  \u201cThe No.1 Car Spotter\u201d which follows Oluwalase Babatunde Benson, the no.1 car spotter in his rural village in an undisclosed country in Africa. Both series of  books are light-hearted and fun and ideal as first chapter books to read alone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/series\/275966-agent-zaiba-investigates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Agent Zaiba Investigates \u2013 Annabelle Sami,<\/a> 6 years+<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Ideal for new readers, the  text in this story is broken up with numerous illustrations. Zaiba loves  to find an excuse to practise being a proper  detective so when some diamonds go missing from her cousin\u2019s henna  party, she springs into action. A very energetic adventure set in a  British Pakistani family.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/36635202-lightning-girl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lightening Girl \u2013 Alesha Dixon, 8 years+<\/a><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of a series of books  about 10 year old Aurora Beam who discovers she has secret powers whilst  sticking up for her little sister in the school  playground. She later learns her mum is secretly a superhero and has to  work out how to balance her everyday life with her newfound powers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/en\/book\/show\/41710162-asha-the-spirit-bird\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Asha and the Spirit Bird \u2013 Jasbinder Bilan<\/a>, 8 years+<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The story follows a young  girl, Asha, travelling from her home in the foothills of the Himalayas  to find her father who has gone to earn some money  in a far off city. The subject matter is dark at times but the tone is  constantly reassuring and has a magical, fairy tales quality. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/39884333-the-boy-at-the-back-of-the-class\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Boy at The Back Of The Class \u2013 Onjali Q Rauf<\/a>, 8 years +<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Told from the perspective of a  9-and-nearly-three-quarter year old, The Boy at The Back of the Class  follows four friend who tried to befriend and  then help the enigmatic new boy who sits at the back of their class.  This book expertly explores difficult issues around the refugee crisis,  losing a parent and navigating the confusing world of politics in an  entirely age appropriate way. There is such humour  and tenderness throughout.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For upper primary, many of  the books featuring characters of colour, disabled characters and LGBT  characters are issues based. While this can be  helpful, it\u2019s also necessary for children to read stories with diverse  characters not simple overcoming barriers. My children have found that  crime fiction is one genre that seems to do well in terms of  representation so our recommendations are quite weighted  towards detective stories. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/1184305.The_London_Eye_Mystery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The London Eye Mystery \u2013 Siobhan Dowd<\/a>, 9 years+<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In The London Eye Mystery, a  brother and sister investigative team try to work out how their cousin  took a ride on the London Eye and never came  off again. The story focuses on the plot rather than the leader  character\u2019s Asperger\u2019s diagnosis. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/31176543-the-guggenheim-mystery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Guggenheim Mystery \u2013 Robin Stevens<\/a>, 9 years+<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The same cousin and siblings team of Kat, Ted and Salim from the The  London Eye Mystery appear in the Guggenheim Mystery where Ted\u2019 Aunt  Gloria is framed for the theft of a painting from the museum.

The population is divided into two: the white Noughts are second-class  citizens, and the black Crosses are highly-revered and perceived as the  superior race. 15-year-old Callum is a Nought, and his best friend,  Sephy, as well as being a Cross, is also the daughter  of one of the most influential politicians in the country. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/32075671-the-hate-u-give\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Hate U Give \u2013 Angie Thomas<\/a>, 12 years+<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Although recommended for 12 years+ this is a great book for adults to  read too.

As well as  excellent representation, this programme has great music with each of  the main characters assuming a different musical genre. Although there  are battles between the \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018evil\u2019 forces,  ultimately the only way to win in Steven Universe is through emotional  growth and understanding. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt7745956\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">She-ra and the Princesses of Power<\/a><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A contemporary re-make of the  80\u2019s classic, She-Ra and the Princesses of Power is an openly queer  cartoon for children of all ages that eschews  binaries of all kinds. Even the treatment of good vs\u2019 evil is nuanced  and, as with in Steven Universe, emotional growth is what all the  characters are constantly working towards. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt1825683\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Black Panther<\/a><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Set in Wakanda, a small, isolationist, landlocked country in Africa. Two foes conspire to destroy it and superhero Black Panther works with special forces from Wakanda and USA to try and prevent it from being dragged into a world war. Unaccustomed as we are to a majority black cast in a  Hollywood action movie, this film is a such a treat in giving viewers a  range of complex, three-dimensional, Black characters  to watch as well as exploring themes of colonialism and generational  trauma.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0298228\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Whale Rider<\/a><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Whale Rider tells the story  of a young Maori girl, Pai, who challenges tradition and embraces the  past in order to find the strength to lead her  people forward.
