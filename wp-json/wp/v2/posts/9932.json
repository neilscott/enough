The programme combines online sessions over seven weeks with a four day residential learning retreat at Whatton Lodge, Gullane, East Lothian. It is delivered jointly by Enough! Scotland and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.che.ac.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Centre for Human Ecology<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Key components of the course:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">\u2022 Weekly online sessions: Tuesdays 7pm &#8211; 9pm, Oct 17th \u2013 Dec 5th 2023<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">\u2022 A residential learning retreat and field trip, <a href=\"https:\/\/whattonlodge.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Whatton Lodge, Gullane<\/a>, Nov 16th-20th<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">\u2022 Co-learning lab and gathering, 9th Dec (Central Scotland, venue tbc) : final event with sharing of participants\u2019 learning<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">\u2022 Self-directed study: through a course handbook, online resources and a practice-based inquiry \/ study \/ creative exploration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">\u2022 At least three additional peer group meetings will be held over the period of the course (times to be agreed by participants)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Description<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">In times marked by accelerating climate breakdown, and social ad economic volatility, uncertainty and complexity, the knowledge and skills required to understand and navigate the metacrisis call for new forms of education and community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">We will explore together where we are now, how we got here, and what we can do about it. DE\/GROWTH means engaging with the framing and literature on degrowth: new economic thinking in response to biophysical limits &#8211; such as redistribution of resources, work and, global solidarity &#8211; while drawing on the deep roots of human ecology to explore belonging in relation to communities of place, climate justice and ecological sustainability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">During the course, together we\u2019ll create a collaborative learning community around the core themes, and create ripples to embed principles and practices of degrowth and human ecology among community and climate activists across Scotland. We draw upon methods taken from popular education practice, building on a rich heritage of radical pedagogy.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Residential<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">The residential takes place at Whatton Lodge, Gullane, East Lothian, home of Lothian Mineworkers Convalescent Home Trust, which was set-up in 1948 to provide breaks and respite for ex-miners and their families after serious accidents or illness. Situated by the Gullane sand dunes, with a gate to the beach, the home of this year\u2019s residential offers a beautiful and comfortable setting for learning, as well as a suitable venue to reflect on the meaning and memory of deindustrialisation in Scotland and its legacy of extractivism and inequality, which will be explored in the course content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">The residential is a transformative learning community in microcosm: designed to complement the online sessions with in-person collaboration and cooperation around the learning content and other group activities. It has four main components: learning sessions exploring human ecology, degrowth, the solidarity economy, and regenerative cultures, guided experiences engaging with land\/waterscapes and each other,: peer groups meeting to discuss and inquire into their questions together, open space where participants self-organise sessions around specific topics or activities: and place-based learning from the community and bioregion. And no residential is complete without a self-organised ceilidh!<br><br>Please note that travel to and from the residential must be met by participants individually. If these are a barrier, please let us know when completing the application form below and we may be able to support your travel.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Who is the course for?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">People normally based in (or with a connection to) Scotland who are active in their community and\/or activist groups and keen to learn with like-minded peers.

This will comprise a Co-Learning Lab and gathering on the 9<sup>th<\/sup> December 2023, in which the knowledge created during the course will be shared more widely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Participants, upon completing the course, will be eligible to receive a Certificate of Completion.
