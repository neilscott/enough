In a direct challenge to the orthodoxy of growth at all costs, the Scottish Degrowth Commission is seeking to explore the concepts of degrowth, deep adaptation-in-solidarity and related ideas and explore what they would mean in a Scottish context. In this session, we argue that in order to mobilise resources required to respond to the climate emergency according to principles of social and environmental justice, livelihoods will need to be reconfigured under different potential governance scenarios, taking into account Brexit and the case for Scottish independence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We invite contributions around the following topics:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> &#8211; Degrowth livelihoods and Just Transitions in Scotland <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; The Scottish independence movement and lessons for degrowth: What have we learned?
