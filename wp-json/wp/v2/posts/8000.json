In visiting sites that are, in the weary phrase \u2018left-behind\u2019 \u2013 I want to ask what models for cultural and community-based resilience remain when the vanguard of late-capitalism has long since disappeared from the horizon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Focused\non a set of mining communities: the journey will be dark, literally\nand figuratively. I want to propose that this \u2018darkness,\u2019 as in\nmuch European folklore, is rich with the potential for discovery. \n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The\njourney will take in coal communities situated in diverse geographic\nand cultural contexts, poised at various different stages of\ntransition \u2013 from pits long-defunct, to those still powering the\nfactories of Central Europe. Along the way, I will connect with local\nactivists contending with the pervasive challenges of ecological\ndestruction and the rise of the far-right. \n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\nwill travel with artefacts from the Scottish coalfield, sourced from\nthe archive, to provoke discussion about communities built around\nextractive industries \u2013 where \u2018de-growth\u2019 of local economies\nhas long been a lived reality. Older, slower, forms of movement,\nfundamental to Scotland\u2019s once vast carbon export industry, play a\nrole here too. These links demonstrate that commerce and cultural\nexchange predate the carbon era, and, even at the height of the coal\nindustry\u2019s massive export boom, facilitated the emergence of\ncultural and social ties. \n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A\nkey inspiration is Jan Moir and John Berger\u2019s 1975 work of\nnarrative non-fiction, <em>A\nSeventh Man,<\/em>\nwhich observed the transient life of migrants across Europe \u2014\nrevealing the notionally marginal figure of the migrant as absolutely\ncentral to modern experience. Similarly, by looking closely at the\nlives of several European carbon communities, often located in\ngeographically peripheral areas, this journey sets out to map a new\ngeography of power and change. By channelling voices from communities\nthat have generally been viewed as marginal to life in contemporary\nEurope, I will ask what it means to be the last generation of workers\nin an industry so central to the continent\u2019s historic dominance.\nThe journey is premised on the certainty that we can only pursue a\nworthwhile low-carbon future, by first exploring the links, cultures\nand solidarities forged in the carbon era.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\nalso want to consider what a Green New Deal will mean in radically\ndifferent contexts across the continent \u2013 with an eye on the\norigins of the European project in the Coal and Steel Community \u2013 a\nfundamentally resource based effort, but also a great moral venture. \n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\nWhere\nmight a new founding moment be located? Rather than the towering\nglass centres of financial and political power, I want to look\nunderground \u2013 in the hills and forests so often dismissed as dirty,\ndark and backward \u2013 the places where transformations have always\ntaken place. \n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Chris\nSilver is a writer and researcher, with a particular interest in\nculture, community activism, working class heritage, and post-carbon\ntransition. <\/strong><\/em>\n<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u2018\u2026in the era of global warming, nothing is really far away; there is no place where the orderly expectations of bourgeois life hold unchallenged sway.\u2019 Amitav Ghosh, The Great Derangement: Climate Change and the Unthinkable Setting out at a moment of profound disconnection and disruption \u2013 in mid-winter \u2013 my journey will trace a route [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":16,"featured_media":8004,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"rank_math_lock_modified_date":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[93],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-8000","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-routes"],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8000"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/16"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=8000"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8000\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":8005,"href":"https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8000\/revisions\/8005"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/8004"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=8000"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=8000"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=8000"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
