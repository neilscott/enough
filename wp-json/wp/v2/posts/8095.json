Their findings  are damning. The drop-off in advanced economies\u2019 resource use \u2013 heralded  by proponents of green growth as the moment when we passed \u2018peak stuff\u2019  \u2013 turns out to be a statistical illusion created by the offshoring of  manufacturing. Once you take into account the resources used in  factories elsewhere to produce the goods and services we consume, the  growth of our economies is more stuff-dependent than ever. Meanwhile,  the ever-narrowing pathways towards the Paris goals for limiting global  warming are paved by carbon capture technologies that are either  \u2018unproven or dangerous at scale\u2019 \u2013 or dependent on decarbonisation  rates, if we start right now, that are vastly greater than seems  plausible for any economy without an overall slowdown in activity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having surveyed the evidence and probed the models, Hickel and Kallis\n conclude that green growth is a fantasy born out of desperation. \u2018It is\n not politically acceptable to question economic growth,\u2019 they write, \n\u2018therefore green growth must be true, since the alternative is \ndisaster.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/N5PzAk8KJGw\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"><\/iframe><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Writer Dougald Hine reflects on the growth dilemma &#8211; and argues &#8220;The need for economic growth is a social construct, not a law of nature.&#8221; &#8220;In a recent issue of the journal New Political Economy, Jason Hickel and Giorgos Kallis ask \u2018Is Green Growth Possible?\u2019 They set about examining the empirical basis for claims about [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":7,"featured_media":8098,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"rank_math_lock_modified_date":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[87],"tags":[77,162],"class_list":["post-8095","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-degrowth","tag-degrowth","tag-notes-from-underground"],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8095"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/7"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=8095"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8095\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":8099,"href":"https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8095\/revisions\/8099"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/8098"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=8095"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=8095"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=8095"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
