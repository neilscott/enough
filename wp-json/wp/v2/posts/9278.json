But it\u2019s also the noise you hear behind so much of what has become known as <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nudge_theory\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u201cnudge theory\u201d<\/a>, as it observes us poor simians bumping into the sharp edges of a challenging modern world that, somehow and mysteriously, we managed to create.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Officially known as \u201cbehavioural economics\u201d, nudge theory is so-called because it aims to steer we bemused, still-paleolithic creatures around our own social and economic landscape, gently pushing us away from self-destructive behaviours that we can\u2019t help perpetrating.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why can\u2019t we help it? Because beneath our elaborate and intricate worlds of code, law, culture and institutions, say the nudgers, we are essentially hunter-gatherers, whose survival drives persist into the complex present, and lead us astray.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, it\u2019s worse than that: we have figured our, via advertising and marketing (whether commercial or political), how to lead ourselves astray. Some classic examples follow. We have an ancient appetite for sweet and sucrose-intense foodstuffs &#8211; so we can be easily led down the path to over-consumption of junk and processed foods.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our attention flickered around our old savannah landscapes, looking for predators or enemies &#8211; so we can readily become entranced by screens and interaction designs, which consciously and deliberately game those instincts securing our constant attention.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To survive, we sort ourselves into in-groups and out-groups, and develop attachments to kin (whether biological or fictive) &#8211; so we moderns are all-too-susceptible to status wars, identity politics\/marketing, and even tribalism by <a href=\"http:\/\/This Is Your Brain on Nationalism: The Biology of Us and Them\u2019, Robert Sapolsky, Foreign Affairs, March\/April 2019, https:\/\/www.foreignaffairs.com\/articles\/2019-02-12\/your-brain-nationalism\">means of polarisation.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>We have an \u201caversion to loss\u201d more than we have an \u201cattraction to gain\u201d, rooted in our early hominid insecurities about storing and retaining resources. Yet at the same time we are also afflicted with \u201coptimism bias\u201d: we routinely overestimate our own chances of success, and the impact of our own skills and talents, in any challenging situation &#8211; again, a capacity we apparently developed as we adapted to our harsh environments.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s amazing.

In such a civilisation, we are (at worst) masters of our evolved and visceral reactions to the world. And at best we are mindful self-shapers and systemic adepts, applying our ingenuity to the pursuit of a planet-friendly common life.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As far as my reading in the last 20 years can tell me, there is more than enough evidence in the human sciences to support our capacity for this kind of fully-awake, complex living. But we need to start arranging it all into a new map &#8211; one that can fully contend with the depressing overview of the nudgers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first point of intervention would be to widen the \u201cdashboard\u201d of primary emotions that are understood as triggering our most \u201cpredictably irrational\u201d responses.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the Scottish independence movement, the spectre of \u201cProject Fear\u201d &#8211; the name the No side gave to their scaremongering referendum campaign in 2012-2014 &#8211; contains one of the key \u201cnegative\u201d emotions that can be seen to deeply drive human (and indeed mammalian) existence. Yet there are potential Projects also for both Anger and Panic\/Sadness (this latter emotion rooted in anxiety around separation, aloneness and abandonment. Does that ring a bell?).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one end of the \u201cprimary emotions\u201d dashboard as laid out by the late Jaak Panksepp, founder of what\u2019s called \u201caffective neuroscience\u201d or AN (which distinguishes itself from cognitive neuroscience (CN) in its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/articles\/10.3389\/fnins.2018.01025\/full\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">emphasis on how our ancestral emotions deeply determine our consciousness<\/a>).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is exciting about Panksepp and AN is that the dashboard extends towards other primary emotions &#8211; and these are as positive and generative as the others are negative and defensive. Panksepp titles them Care, Play and Seeking\/Curiosity (he even fully CAPITALISES them, to emphasize their primacy in organisms, but I won\u2019t follow that rule here).<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It shouldn\u2019t be hard to imagine how one might begin to orchestrate these three emotional systems in service of an ecological civilisation &#8211; particularly if we attend to Panksepp\u2019s particular definitions. What\u2019s also important to note is that AN believes these are \u201cvisceral\u201d emotions &#8211; meaning that to the human experiencing them, they are near involuntary reactions: we are \u201cpulled\u201d towards them, and they contend powerfully within us. (To my mind, this is a different framing of emotion than that of the nudgers, who delight in how our noble and rational intentions are endlessly subverted by our evolved inheritance. Instead, these are emotions understood more operatically, as a profound and turbulent motivational landscape, the primal drama of our lives).&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Care &#8211; essentially, maternal and paternal protection and development of offspring, community members, or any other entities requiring nurturance and support &#8211; seems obviously useful. Environmental discourse is powerful when it invokes Mother Earth or Gaia; and the concept of the Anthropocene implies a story in which we are responsible for the fate of the blue planet. To care for an entity is not to be transactional with it, or to have one\u2019s emotions subverted by individualism or ego.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet we can amplify the power of Care with the power of Play, as an emotional system. Care provides the human organism with the experience of being at home in, being loved and esteemed by, the world. And Play stands upon the security Care generates, in order to healthily (and joyfully) experiment and test how we can be in that world.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Far from being trivial or a diversion, in evolutionary terms Play is how social, symbolic, imaginative animals like us rehearse being with each other. It creates zones (and much of the arts can be subsumed in the Play system) in which realities are simulated, put together and taken apart, with the risks taken being merely discursive or creative, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.journalofplay.org\/sites\/www.journalofplay.org\/files\/pdf-articles\/9-2-article-1-ethology.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">not life-or-death.&nbsp;<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>When we understand how Play operates in the evolved human condition, we can break through the way that advertising (and digitality) hold promises of novelty and new worlds just out of reach of their consumers, in an endless and addictive fashion. Instead, if we try to access the creative and prototypical impulse at the heart of Play, and instil it with the empathy of Care, we end up with the young climate strikers and Extinction Rebellion\u2019s most successful moments &#8211; turning streets into alternative communities of performance, discourse and bravery. Into \u201cgrounds of play\u201d.&nbsp;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeking\/Curiosity is a deep emotional system for Panksepp, which goes way beyond the mammalian realm, and is essentially to do with the inner state of any organism, which needs to ascertain what its external environment is &#8211; whether sustaining or threatening &#8211; and moves around in the world to seek out that evidence. At the human level, philosophers like Spinoza called this \u201cconatus\u201d &#8211; understood as drive, will, motive.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeking\/Curiosity sits below and beyond Anger, Fear, Panic, Care or Play. It manifests as a desire than can\u2019t requite itself, or the impulse to action rather than passivity in a situation. Such desire is clearly harnessable in many directions, and for many different \u201cProjects\u201d. (There is a seventh primary and visceral emotion in the Panksepp system, Lust, which shouldn\u2019t go without saying &#8211; but perhaps needs another essay to integrate into our picture, as it can either integrate or unravel those in its grip).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The science of emotions, as explored by other figures like Antonio Damasio, often connect this desire to the need for \u201chomeostasis\u201d in organisms &#8211; a term you may know as referring to self-balancing and self-correction (like the homeostat regulating the heating in your house). Damasio prefers the term \u201chomeodynamics\u201d. This is the gentle flourishing which is the ideal state for a healthy organism &#8211; keeping enough energy resources in reserve, to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ONByvKuMa4w\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fuel a curiosity about your environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When connected to Play, and particularly when it happens in the super-playful human animal, this Seeking\/Curiosity is the drive behind the elaborate structures and rules of our civilisations. Of course, all of these emotional systems fuel the more self-conscious, cognitive and imaginative parts of our minds, which grow the cultures that are between us. We can imagine (and remember) civilisations that are (and were) founded on the visceral triggering of Fear, Anger and Panic\/Sadness.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet I am strongly suggesting that affective neuroscience should give activists the confidence to identify, and then to cultivate, the more \u201cpositive\u201d and generative primary emotions. They can be deep motivators towards building an ecological civilisation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>***<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A final caveat. The human sciences (and particularly the sciences of emotions) are a crowded, contested and constantly shifting field. A recent challenge to affective neuroscience\u2019s map of evolved and deeply rooted emotions comes from the constructionist model, preeminently developed by the aforementioned <a href=\"https:\/\/lisafeldmanbarrett.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lisa Feldman Barrett.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s \u201cconstructionist\u201d because Barrett and her peers believe that emotions are much more culturally constructed (and culturally relative) than they are a set of \u201cessential\u201d emotional modules. In a sardonic way, she charges essentialists as invoking \u201can inner beast that needed to be controlled by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.chronicle.com\/article\/the-secret-history-of-emotions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">divine, rational thought\u201d.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her own laboratory studies and literature reviews aim to refute the idea that we have a \u201cfear\u201d circuit or \u201cplay\u201d circuit in the brain. For Feldman, the emotions are much more emergent between a human and their environment. They arising from the meeting of a flexible brain network that\u2019s constantly anticipating our reality; and a culture\/language that gives us more subtlety in handling emotions, the more culture we imbibe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means, as far as I understand her work, that our emotive, motivated selves are far more shapeable by a powerful story, metaphor or image (still or moving) that we have been previously prepared to accept. Yet if we understand this, claims Barrett, we can then take on the responsibility to re-story ourselves. And now aware that we have a much greater capacity to do this than we realised.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I find myself placed somewhere between the \u201cessentialist\u201d and the \u201cconstructionist\u201d positions in this debate, these two camps of the neuroscience of emotions and cognition. I think it\u2019s important that humans realise how homologous they are with other mammals, and even organisms beyond that. It feels like a biological connection, a shared fate, which might be transforming if dwelt upon deeply enough.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also appreciate that we are also radically constructionist animals &#8211; with extraordinary capacities for self-reflection, conceptualisation, fabulation. We will need all those imaginative powers, rethinking not just technology but styles and ways of life, if we are to get out of the 2020s alive.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At least, let\u2019s say that there\u2019s more to us, and our evolved resources, than Homer Economicus.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Pat Kane is a writer, musician, activist, consultant and futurist (<\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.patkane.global\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>www.patkane.global<\/em><\/a><em>).
