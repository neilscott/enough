An author of many books, papers and UN  reports on aspects of sustainable development, Bendell now focuses on  supporting people from various professions to explore our challenging  predicament.

This  includes: approaches informed by solidarity and love; systems thinking;  pondering the nature of power; or exploring countercultural and  prefigurative ways of organising that dismantle old norms and prototype  new narratives\u2026 ways that will perpetuate the culture shift needed.&nbsp;@gehan_macleod<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/lrh_bhm.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7877\" width=\"237\" height=\"206\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/lrh_bhm.jpg 772w, https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/lrh_bhm-300x261.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/lrh_bhm-768x669.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/lrh_bhm-585x509.jpg 585w, https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/lrh_bhm-100x87.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 237px) 100vw, 237px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>layla-roxanne hill<\/strong> is a writer\/curator-artist\/activist-organiser whose areas of interest lie in decolonisation\/(de)construction of cultural production, marginality and Black Scottish lives. she writes for&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/bellacaledonia.org.uk\/contributor\/layla-roxanne-hill\/\" target=\"_blank\">Bella Caledonia<\/a>, is curator for&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.enough.scot\/\" target=\"_blank\">Enough!<\/a>&nbsp;&#8211; Scotland&#8217;s response to our ecological, economic and social crisis and is a Director at&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/theferret.scot\/\" target=\"_blank\">The Ferret<\/a>&nbsp;&#8211; Scotland&#8217;s investigative journalism co-operative. layla-roxanne advocates for non-commodifiable collective liberation, is also active within the trade union movement, holding positions within the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) and is Chair of the Scottish TUC Black Workers\u2019 Committee.
