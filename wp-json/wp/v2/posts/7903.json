At a time when enormous\nindustrial growth had created a vogue for speed and motion, the metaphorical\nlink to transport was clear. Amidst all those new railways, steam packets\nploughing the oceans, and telegraph wires buzzing underneath them \u2014 the\nassociation of new politics with the raw energy of industry and progress, that\ntransformed everything it touched beyond recognition, was perhaps\ninevitable.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The age of steam, steel and smoke has gone from Scotland. But\nsomething of the way we might want to be radical retains that idea of\nforwardness and motion that the dirty monstrous machines of Victorian\ncapitalism first inspired. In contrast, techno-optimists and most of the\nprogressive political establishment now project a clean carbon-free future,\nwhere our bodies will be whisked around as seamlessly as a byte of data along a\nfibreoptic cable. But mainstream ideas about how we organise the world are\nstill grounded in our grimy past far more than many would care to admit. As\nexpressed in the latest advert for the electric Nissan Leaf, we may wish to\nfloat into the futuristic ether, but the reality of feeding machines \u2014 made\nmore efficiently, in ever greater numbers \u2014 is resource depletion. All of this\ndynamism (expansion) is fired, one way or another, by the exploitation of cheap\nnatural inputs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s never easy to look at the things capitalism would prefer\nhidden \u2014 and many of its key innovations in recent years have been about better\nmasking and obscuring the inherent waste, exploitation, and spiralling\ninequality propagated by \u2018wealth creation\u2019 and the mindless pursuit of growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Old Futures<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the enormity of our own industrial revolution now largely\npart of folk memory, contemporary Scottish capitalism sees itself as the smooth\ntram ride that takes you out to Edinburgh Airport, via immaculate financial\nservices offices and reflecting pools. But an equally accurate image of our\n\u2018dynamic\u2019 Scottish economy today is Linwood \u2014 the small Renfrewshire town\nforever associated with the much loved, if notoriously temperamental, Hillman\nImp. There\u2019s plenty of movement happening in this small corner of the nation \u2014\nflights in and out of Glasgow Airport, the constant hum of the nearby M8. But\nall those journeys that began here with steel sourced from Ravenscraig, that\nincluded a notoriously inefficient return trip south of the border, are no\nlonger possible. The lot of Scotland\u2019s post-industrial towns like Linwood was\nnot so much to disappear \u2014 it was to stop being locations where things started,\nto become places that people wanted to avoid, to move around. Trip up in the\nmobility game, and you easily find yourself lost.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But let\u2019s not dismiss the democratic dreams captured by Scotland\u2019s\nnational vehicle \u2013 and its central role as heroic failure of the post-war\nBritish car industry. The Imp once represented a bridge to the brightest of\nlight manufacturing futures for workers weaned in the cradle of Victorian heavy\nindustry. But for many, the rise of car ownership meant something far more\npersonal too. The freedom of getaways in a cheap, efficient, vehicle brought\nthe luxury of movement and travel to the many. Whole cities were reshaped\naround this grand vision of a family of four moving at 70 mph of their own\naccord. The bright era of social mobility enjoyed by baby boomers was made\ntangible by this new literalauto-mobility.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could step back, of course, and cooly critique the chaos and\ndamage created by this oddly conformist freedom \u2014 not least because it was\ninitially premised on cheap oil secured by the rearguard of empire. But that\ndoesn\u2019t mean this freedom was any less real to those who experienced it. This\nrevolutionary extension of mobility opened up the country and the many worlds\nwithin it. Like most revolutions, the death toll was contested (but almost\ncertainly high) much of the old still lingered on alongside the new, and many\nof the impacts are still unravelling. But sometimes you just have to move with\nthe times.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The\nSovereign Driver <\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As <a href=\"#https:\/\/books.google.co.uk\/books?id=VTFFDwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=David+Edgerton&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s\">David Edgerton<\/a> has\ndemonstrated, the Fordist model of \u2018welfare capitalism\u2019 \u2014 with its core\ncommitment to affording workers a wage high enough to buy their own product \u2014 developed\nin the UK in explicitly nationalist terms. As a result, the ability to make and\nexport cars has long been a symbol of national self-sufficiency, virility even.\nBehind coverage of this ever-more precarious sector, with Brexit looming over\nwhat remains of the British car industry, a distinctly <em>national<\/em> anxiety\nis still present. &nbsp;Cross-border supply\nchains may guarantee that each vehicle that rolls off an assembly line in\nBritain is a thoroughly cosmopolitan machine, but the possibility of car\nfactory closures still seems to ask a bigger question.<br>\n<br>\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Namely, is a nation-state without the ability to make its own cars\nreally worthy of the title? As <a href=\"#https:\/\/www.lrb.co.uk\/login?href=\/v31\/n11\/andrew-ohagan\/a-car-of-ones-own\">Andrew O\u2019Hagan noted<\/a> in response\nto Labour\u2019s 2009 attempt to boost national car production with a scrappage\nscheme, \u201cThe downturn in the industry chills us, but mainly because \u2013 and we\ndon\u2019t feel this way about pharmaceuticals or petrochemicals \u2013 it makes us\nimagine we might have to stop being who we are.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This deep identification, he argues, is partly due to an imaginative\nrelationship that casts drivers as \u201csovereign in their cars.\u201d Perhaps it was a\nsimilar idea of sovereignty that inspired the <em>Gilets Jaunes <\/em>to adopt a\nuniform which identified them explicitly as drivers \u2014 as free individuals who feel\nthe social contract between citizen-driver and state has expired. In Scotland,\nthe <a href=\"#https:\/\/www.commonspace.scot\/articles\/14119\/learn-gilets-jaunes-stuc-urge-scottish-government-fix-broken-promises-new-green-jobs\">STUC has not been coy<\/a> in implying\nthat, without establishing a national stake in, and productive base for,\nScotland\u2019s new low-carbon economy, a botched transition could lead to similar\nsocial unrest here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But support for a sovereign vehicle owner\u2019s democracy, Margaret\nThatcher\u2019s \u201cgreat car economy,\u201d also means accepting a map of immobility and\nsocial exclusion. This is a key area of policy where Scotland has dutifully\nfollowed in Maggie\u2019s footsteps. Bus services for the poor remain deregulated\nand cars rule our roads thanks to lavish state support. Less than a decade ago\nwe opened the M74 extension (\u00a3692m) \u2014 a motorway constructed through\ncommunities with some of the lowest levels of car ownership in the UK, in full\nknowledge of its negative environmental and social impacts and against the <a href=\"#https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-13931242\">advice of a public\ninquiry<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Road building remains a dominant governing priority in Scotland,\nwith several flagship projects showing the continued popular political\ncommitment to private cars and their insatiable appetite for greater road\ncapacity \u2014 including the Queensferry Crossing (\u00a31.35bn) and the long-awaited\nAberdeen Western Peripheral Route (\u00a31bn). Current plans also include further\nroad improvement and building schemes, amounting to roughly \u00a31bn of public\nspending across five projects. This can only embed issues around our carbon\nheavy transport sector \u2014 the dirtiest in the Scottish economy, and one which\nsaw a<a href=\"#https:\/\/www.theccc.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Reducing-emissions-in-Scotland-2018-Progress-Report-to-Parliament.pdf\"> notable <em>increase<\/em>\nin emissions over the period 2011-16.<\/a> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Electric Escapism<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, the Scottish Futures Trust has placed fresh emphasis on\nelectric vehicle charging points \u2014 with an eye on the Scottish Government\u2019s\nambitious aim to phase out combustion engines in Scotland by 2032. However,\nlike most proposals that offer seamless change (the sovereign driver in his\ndangerous metal box will remain the key subject of how we organise moving\npeople around) this policy ignores extensive evidence that electric vehicles\nstill contribute substantial emissions over the course of their lifecycle,\ncurrently between <a href=\"#https:\/\/www.eea.europa.eu\/highlights\/eea-report-confirms-electric-cars\">17-30% less than\ninternal combustion engines.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, experts have pointed out that air quality issues will\nremain, largely due to particles from brake pads and tyres. This is the point\nat which the futuristic desire to float into some mystical future begins to\ninfect policy \u2014 the shiny newness of products imbued with ideas of ethereal\ncleanliness promising an escape from the present, and by implication from the\nfinite resources of the planet itself. Yet the reality remains over-tourism\nbased on luring motorists en-masse to overburdened rural roads, and poorer\ncommunities still disproportionately impacted by bad air quality and road traffic\naccidents. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Globally, the inequality embedded by private car use is even\nstarker. Around 85% of the world\u2019s cars are owned by 15% of the population \u2014\nand growing the electric private fleet into the hundreds of millions will be\neasily cancelled out by the massive overall rise in vehicles, <a href=\"#https:\/\/theecologist.org\/2019\/jan\/25\/electric-cars-wont-stop-rising-oil-demand)\">set to double to two\nbillion by 2035<\/a>. Technology cannot substitute the enormous political\nbravery required to re-balance our priorities away from roads and cars.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Invisible Industry <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The assertive language that once mobilised Scottish nationalism\naround national industry \u2014 that saw post-industrial towns like Linwood seared into the national psyche by the\nProclaimers&#8217; \u2018no more\u2019 refrain \u2014 has largely disappeared. The sovereign consumer\nat the wheel of the family saloon is still with us as a political subject, the\nworker who built it is not.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As <a href=\"#https:\/\/conter.co.uk\/blog\/2019\/7\/26\/the-caley-and-scotlands-invisible-workers\">Ewan Gibbs argued<\/a>, the\nclosure of the Caley rail works in Glasgow provides just one example of how, \u201cScotland\u2019s existing industrial workers are\nrendered historicised and invisible.\u201d Devolution has not inherited this\nvisceral link between the politics of the nation, and the politics of work and\nindustry that emerged in the final decades of the last century. This poses\nparticularly acute challenges for the current transition to a low-carbon\neconomy, which has seen <a href=\"#https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-scotland-scotland-business-49096996\">wind-farm jackets\nfabricated in Indonesia<\/a> and shipped to be deployed in the waters off Scotland \u2014\nconspicuously visible from the former industrial heartlands of Fife. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is just one of the countless local\nmanifestations of Naomi Klein\u2019s key insight about the climate crisis: \u2018we have\nnot done the things that are necessary to lower emissions because those things\nfundamentally conflict with deregulated capitalism.\u2019 The big ideological shift\nto neoliberalism in the 1980s has left countries like Scotland shorn of the\nindustries, skills, public assets and political will required to enact radical\nchange for the common good. <br>\n<br>\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scotland\u2019s oft-cited (and probably\noverstated) antipathy towards the core tenets of Thatcherism and its\nsuccessors, does not provide a free pass out of this deeper dilemma, and the\nmanagerialist constraints of devolution seem largely ill-equipped to offer a\nfresh perspective. Either way, as Christopher Harvie argued in his 2001 polemic\non the dire state of car-centric Scottish transport policy, we have to confront\nthe reality of Scotland as: \u2018a deindustrialised society, no longer capable of\nputting together the sort of technology &#8211; a combination of high-tech and\ntraditional craftsmanship &#8211; which a modern and environmentally-sustainable\ncountry required.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite all that it represented, the\nshort-lived Scottish car industry is now another dusty artefact in our draughty\nnational museum of industrial loss. But how might we re-cast a new vision of\npride, ownership and universalism embodied in the freedom of the open road? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We could depart from the clogged\nmotorways of the central belt and instead look north to Orkney. With a surplus\nof community renewable energy, and inadequate grid infrastructure to export it\nsouth, the islands\u2019 electric car pool operates as a grid battery. In this\nmodel, the driver\u2019s traditional \u2018sovereign\u2019 isolation is inverted: each journey\nbecomes viable as part of a shared network, mobility becomes an asset held in\ncommon. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A Different Pace? <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the mid 20th century, in step with a burgeoning car culture, Scotland\u2019s planners were convinced that population density was the mother of all urban ills. They would go on to pursue measures radical enough to destroy whole communities in an effort to disperse populations. From within a system, such ideologically inspired targets lie beyond question. Looked at from without, after the institutional consensus has crumbled: they are often revealed as absurd and arbitrary. <br> <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps part of the problem in establishing a coherent and radical\nalternative vision is the all-encompassing need for speed itself. In an age\nwhen billions of pounds literally move through markets in nanoseconds (in some\ncases causing vast losses that we don\u2019t fully understand) slowness can be, if\nnot radical, at least advisable. We need long term, low-return investment,\nparticularly in grid infrastructure and public transport. The big change\nrepresented by a Green New Deal or Just Transition must be rapid in\nimplementation, but to work, it must accept an economy that can operate at a\ndifferent pace.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Time is the sole irreducible unit of value in our lives. Once it\nis spent, we cannot get it back. The fight to protect time from the\nencroachment of capital is a long one \u2014 a slogan within the historic mass\ninternational movement for an eight-hour working day is useful here: \u201cshorten\nour hours to prolong our lives\u201d. That workers were previously often expected to\nwork well over 60 hours in a six-day week, seems barbaric. Yet today, a\nUniversal Credit claimant is expected to accept a job offer that requires them\nto spend no less than <em>three hours a day<\/em>\ntravelling to and from work. For many, the need for mobility is a brutal,\nsoul-sapping, imposition in pursuit of an arbitrary goal.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An economy that does not steer itself towards the accumulation of\never more things, ripped from the earth at any cost, is also one which would\nnot demand constant movement. It would escape the tyranny of clocked time\n(first introduced in the Victorian factory system to quell labour discontent)\nand foreground instead the rhythms of other frames for labour long made\ninvisible by capitalism \u2014 care and nurture, the pattern of the seasons and the\ndiligence of craft. The alternative is still more rapid depletion of our lives\nas human beings, and, ultimately, of the entire web of life on this planet\ntoo.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Roads to Nowhere: can Scotland Escape the \u2018Great Car Economy?\u2019 The use of the term \u201cmovement\u201d to describe mass political organisation has its origins in the mid-19th century.
