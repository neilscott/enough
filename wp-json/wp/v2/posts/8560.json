This conversation examined the importance of narratives that don\u2019t perpetuate the dominant, capitalist, post-colonialist worldview, looking at examples of helpful and damaging resources available and sharing ideas of how to use your existing materials to promote critical analysis in children of all ages. Brought to you with humility and an understanding that working towards decolonised parenting is not a linear progression, that we are all learning all the time and how much we can learn from each other. <strong>You can watch the full talk <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cPPcPigSs1U&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;fbclid=IwAR2pAA4MAlYK4xVeXGYNPhjG4GAY7EV6Ogo0lUxaatMGBXNgahyCXBdXYCY&amp;app=desktop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>here<\/strong><\/a><strong>.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sapna Agarwal<\/strong> is a community activist, parent and long-term home educator.
