This represents an argument with scientific method \u2013 in so far as national truths become incompatible with basic ideas that have shaped modern industrial societies. Rejecting complexity, this belief centres on the nation as the only whole collective body we can recognise: a place that has heartlands, where honest nationals once did tough honest work. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In\n2015, when US senator Jim Inhofe brought a snowball to Capitol Hill for a\ndebate on climate change, he wasn\u2019t simply arguing with a demonstrable reality,\nhe was asserting a belief in the nation as a greater, religious, truth. Just as\nthere are no sacrificial rituals dedicated to science, there is no planet in\nthe minds of these men \u2013 just one tribe under god. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8212;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In\nEurope\u2019s coalfields, from Upper Silesia by the waters of the Vistula, to South\nWales on the shores of the Atlantic \u2013 mining is seen as a vital old tradition; not\nquite, but soon to be lost to history. Solidarity and the raw truth of this\nwork \u2013 with its dirt and its danger \u2013 are regional bedrocks of tradition. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But\ncoal is more present than it has ever been \u2014 both in terms of the amount of\ncarbon that now sits in the atmosphere, and in our continued dependence on a\nworld in which cheap fuel and cheap labour are the basic players in the global\neconomy. But coal is also very old. Too old, in fact, for many of us to\ncomprehend. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This\npoint is not lost on the curators of the Silesian Museum, which opened in 2015.\nSited on a former colliery \u2013 the glass fa\u00e7ades of its spectacular new\nstructures are decorated with images painted by former miner Ludwik Holesz, in\n1968.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Holesz\u2019s\npainting was inspired by a fossilised leaf imprinted on a piece of coal from\nthe Carboniferous period and his painting depicts the flora and fauna, compressed\nthrough millennia, into the riches and energy that made Upper Silesia. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Silesian_Museum_Facade-1-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8155\" srcset=\"https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Silesian_Museum_Facade-1-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Silesian_Museum_Facade-1-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Silesian_Museum_Facade-1-585x780.jpg 585w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Silesian_Museum_Facade-1-1170x1560.jpg 1170w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Silesian_Museum_Facade-1-100x133.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s\na humility to this work too, with its inquisitive-eyed creatures darting with\nvivid colours from behind ferns. All of that colour and imagination, leaping\nfrom out of a primordial darkness, speaks to the kind of perspective and\nvitality required to place the significance of carbon in context. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8212;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From Upper Silesia I travel some 600 miles west, to another heartland: the Ruhr valley. I see familiar uniforms, part of a mining culture that followed Prussian expansion and bedded down in both regions. One small legacy of that state\u2019s military and bureaucratic might \u2013 underpinned by coal itself. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fire machines which so impressed Goethe in the 1790s brought in their wake vast movements of people. They would soon transform the regions where their power was put to use beyond recognition. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steam\nmeant movement, a new animating force for the age. The race to industrialise,\nand get all that cheap energy out of the ground, brought Germans to what is now\nPoland, Poles to the shores of the Rhine, and many other peoples still. However\nmuch the ensuing centuries might have refashioned the flags, borders and\nideologies that ruled above ground \u2013 underneath it, coal held sway \u2013 a magnetic\nforce for the uprooted masses. By the 1890s, the population of the Ruhr stood\nat around two million, compared to three hundred thousand in 1850.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you transform the land, it sets the masses in motion. This is a basic fact but one worth noting. Here\u2019s another to sit beside it: half of all the industrial carbon emissions in our atmosphere date from 1988. This is not something that has to be explained to the Chinese farmer\u2019s son working at Foxconn, but the tragic coincidence of our times is that the observable planetary condition is as present at it is distant and unknowable. These truths invite a shrug: anyway, who can really know a whole world? We are all anchored to some small patch of it \u2013 and it is the genius of carbon nationalism to convince people, in their hearts, that <em>they<\/em> don\u2019t have to move, even as the flames scorch the fringes of the homestead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8212;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are few monuments to the awesome power of coal and steel as spectacular as the Zollverein Industrial complex \u2013 with its iconic double winding gear. Closed in 1986, it was once the most productive mine in the world, today its vast, strange, beauty has won UNESCO World Heritage designation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Ruhrsteps-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8150\" srcset=\"https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Ruhrsteps-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Ruhrsteps-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Ruhrsteps-585x780.jpg 585w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Ruhrsteps-1170x1560.jpg 1170w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Ruhrsteps-100x133.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now housing a range of cultural facilities within its cavernous surroundings, the air around these Bauhaus-inspired structures is clearer than it once was. This is frequently remarked upon by visitors from across Germany, many of whom still view the Ruhr as a smoke-black region of incessant noise and movement. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My guide, Frank Switala, whose grandfather came to the Ruhr at the end of the 19<sup>th<\/sup> century, explains how this perception was grounded in reality. <br><br> \u201cI remember days in my childhood, where everything was polluted by smoke: my grandma tested the wind in the evening and then she decided if she could leave the washing out or take it in.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frank, a child of the post-war boom years, also recalls that this moment of intensive industrial expansion saw the Ruhr became something of a cosmopolitan heartland \u2013 a necessity given German industry&#8217;s thirst for labour.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhen I was kid after school, you could just throw your ball in the back and whistle and get ten or twelve kids around you and that team was as international as Liverpool FC is today.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My\nguide is also eager to tell me about his travels to Wales during the miner\u2019s\nstrike: \u201cmy personal impression at that moment when I was there I thought, hey,\nthis country&#8217;s close to civil war.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He\ncontrasts this with the German state\u2019s willingness to subsidise local coal at\nthe time: \u201cwhat we did was we bought social peace.\u201d <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of that legacy is Zollverein itself. Near the entrance to the Ruhr Museum, within the complex\u2019s former coal washing plant, is a lump of coal from the last shift at the last hard coal mine in Germany, closed in 2018. Visitors are then invited downwards into the depths of the region\u2019s pre-history \u2013 via a glowing orange stairway inspired by molten steel that befits a passage to the underworld. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI find this is one of the best examples for the transition going on. And we try to keep up with the future, because there&#8217;s one day that will be coming when coal mining is a long, long time gone.\u201d<br><br> \u00a0\u201cWe&#8217;re still in transition. This is something that has not completed. Yes. 150 years of industrialization. You cannot undo it in one or two generations,\u201d explains Frank. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8212;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Travelling\nacross Germany, &nbsp;it\u2019s striking to consider\nthat the country that worships Goethe\u2019s mix of enlightenment humanism and\nromantic obsession with prelapsarian nature, is facing political crises and a\nwider sense of angst about its future. The engine room of Europe\u2019s economy is\non a collision course with the contradictions of growth and development, and\nthe consequences of great wealth on a volatile planet. To crib a theme from the\ngreat man\u2019s canon \u2013 looking back, it all seems a bit Faustian. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cheap\ncoal underpinned social democracy and the wonders of post-war economic recovery\nin West Germany. It also lies just under the surface of contemporary divisions\n\u2014 in the poorer East, the country\u2019s green credentials are all too easily\npresented as just another urban fad \u2014 and the opportunistic nationalism of AFD\nis happy to portray climate change as a hoax. Similarly, as a recent scandal\nconcerning a satirical song about a carbon guzzling grandmother shows, the\ndemographic strains occurring across an ageing populace, are part of the\npicture too. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Scott Morrisons and Jim Inhofes of this world would like our memories to be short, and our imaginative sense of history as narrow as a national anthem. Increasingly, carbon-nationalism pits the traditional idealised image of the miner against the migrant \u2013 forgetting that, so often, they have been one and the same. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But far from being bound up with tradition, much of that carbon is fresh \u2013 in 1988 the world produced 8.75 billion tonnes of carbon from coal, compared to 14.57 billion tonnes in 2017. <br><br>All those tonnes of raw energy were some 300 million years in the making. The great anxiety of all those absurd old men, preaching national optimism and holding up coal as the authentic saviour, is a desperate desire to avoid confronting our mortal, finite, condition. Because even in the current orgy of burning, coal reminds us, above all, of our own irrelevance. Something that every miner, mixing his sweat and breath to unsettle awesome geological forces on a day to day basis, learns as an apprentice. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cDuring the industrial era people were forced to endure long and bitter conflicts in their struggle to participate in the political system\u2026It remains to be seen whether the transformation of traditional industrial societies will be accompanied by a regress of democratic structures or whether progress towards more democracy is already culturally anchored and irreversible.\u201d Information [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":16,"featured_media":8156,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":true,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"rank_math_lock_modified_date":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[93],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-8149","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-routes"],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8149"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/16"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=8149"}],"version-history":[{"count":11,"href":"https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8149\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":8168,"href":"https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8149\/revisions\/8168"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/8156"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=8149"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=8149"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=8149"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
