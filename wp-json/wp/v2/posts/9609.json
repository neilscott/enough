Catriona Spaven-Donn and Diana Gardu\u00f1o Jim\u00e9nez weave together threads of food sovereignty activism in Scotland, bioregionalism and the Mayan sharing practice of the cuchubal.<\/em> <em>Illustration by Tarneem Al Mousawi.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"706\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/1024-1486-706x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9610\" srcset=\"https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/1024-1486-706x1024.jpg 706w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/1024-1486-207x300.jpg 207w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/1024-1486-768x1115.jpg 768w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/1024-1486-585x849.jpg 585w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/1024-1486-100x145.jpg 100w, https:\/\/enough.scot\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/1024-1486.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 706px) 100vw, 706px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Degrowth is a radical reimagining of the kind of society we need to create in order to protect our future. When extractivist economic and political systems have changed the very geology of our Earth and led us into the Anthropocene\u2019s age of extinction, we clearly do need a different story.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In bringing together the threads of that story, we must weave cross-cultural thinking and traditional ecological knowledge into the future vision\u2026 for what is future is also what has passed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we reclaim, reimagine, and re-envision, we also question. Doubt creeps in about things we were told as fact \u2013 such as Darwinian theories of competition and the widely accepted idea that we need to compete to stay alive and thrive; that our world rewards the survival of the fittest. Suzanne Simard, renowned ecologist and author of <em>Finding the Mother Tree: Uncovering the Wisdom and Intelligence of the Forest<\/em>, describes her first encounter with mycorrhizal fungus roots and their two-way exchange of soil nutrients and photosynthesised sugars. (1) She realises that the mutualism of this relationship calls into question the idea that competition is essential to evolution and, rather, suggests that co-operation is key. She later writes about the symbiotic nature and diversity of the forest floor:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI have come full circle to stumble onto some of the Indigenous ideals: Diversity matters. And everything in the universe <em>is <\/em>connected \u2013 between the forests and the prairies, the land and the water, the sky and the soil, the spirits and the living, the people and all other creatures.\u201d (p.283)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robin Wall Kimmerer, scientist and enrolled member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, illustrates the same principle of reciprocity in <em>Braiding Sweetgrass<\/em>  (2) through the indigenous agricultural system of the <em>milpa <\/em>or<em> <\/em>Three Sisters, the complementary planting together of starch-rich corn, nitrogen-fixing bean, and high-vitamin squash:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe Three Sisters offer us a new metaphor for an emerging relationship between indigenous knowledge and Western science, both of which are rooted in the earth. I think of the corn as traditional ecological knowledge, the physical and spiritual framework that can guide the curious bean of science, which twines like a double helix. The squash creates the ethical habitat for coexistence and mutual flourishing. I envision a time when the intellectual monoculture of science will be replaced with a polyculture of complementary knowledges. And so all may be fed.\u201d (p.139)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When 80% of global arable land is industrial monoculture and 75% of world food crop biodiversity has been lost (3), all being fed is no small thing. If we are to protect the diversity of our food systems and cultural identities, a shift in our structures of organisation is also imperative. Rather than a focus on colonial national borders, why do we not re-engage with the natural boundaries of rivers and mountains and consider what is possible within our own watersheds? In the context of a just transition to a world of radical sufficiency, this means organising bioregionally \u2013 relocalising our economies, shortening our supply chains, and living in harmony with the land around us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bioregionalism is a different and yet familiar story, an ancestral story of collective wellbeing and ecological approaches. Organising bioregionally is part of the process of achieving self-sufficiency through the co-operation, mutualism, and symbiosis that Simard and Wall Kimmerer suggest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Scotland, mycorrhizal networks of food growers and community gardens are flourishing, creating mutually beneficial relationships for people and planet. We have seen that in the context of Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic, people are paying more attention to food sovereignty, access to local produce, and farmers\u2019 livelihoods. Is this the beginning of a paradigm shift towards sustainable and regenerative relationships with food and its production?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abi Mordin, co-founder of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.glasgowfood.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Glasgow\u2019s Community Food Network<\/a>, calls for co-ordinated collective action in the face of COVID-19, Brexit, and climate change and their impacts on our food system. Along with a burgeoning network of grassroots food growers, she is working towards the diversification of our food production to create community resilience, food security, and affordable and healthy food for those who need it most.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/scottishcommunitiescan.org.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Scottish Communities Climate Action Network<\/a> is also working to implement local solutions and a vibrant system of small-scale local democracy, while encouraging an abundance of local food growers and producers everywhere, including city centres, abandoned land, and temporary spaces. This vision includes the transmission and celebration of cross-generational knowledge exchange.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"http:\/\/nourishscotland.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nourish Scotland<\/a> works for a fair, healthy, and sustainable food system that truly values nature and people. Their Fork to Farm Dialogues are locally-led conversations focused on building trust and relationships between primary food producers and local decision-makers. The dialogues aim to bring farmers\u2019 voices to the fore in the discussions around food systems, agriculture, just transition, and climate change. The Global Fork to Farm Dialogue will take place at COP26, bringing together 100 local government representatives with 100 practising farmers. The dialogues have so far engaged people from Mexico, Scotland, Belgium, Ecuador, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Tanzania. Ancestrality and plurality have been recurring themes of the dialogues. While Mexican participants have re-learned the <em>milpa<\/em> food system that Wall Kimmerer discusses, Scottish participants have also reconnected with the past in order to look to the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For one of the Scottish Fork to Farm participants, the Highland Good Food Partnership, the creation of a sustainable, local food system also involves the possibility of reviving the \u2018shieling system\u2019. In his article, \u2018Ancient Futures for Highland Hills: Reinventing the Shielings,\u2019 Col Gordon explains the shielings as a system in which cattle were herded from low-lying glens and woodlands to graze up in the mountain pastures during the summer months. This seasonal change also marked cultural festivals, local storytelling and song traditions. Gordon comments that \u201cdespite such a harsh environment, historically the native Highlanders carved out indigenous systems of subsistence that were perfectly balanced to their surroundings. Broadly speaking, these were very elegant, efficient and productive and operated within the means of the local ecologies.\u201d (4)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the introduction of sheep during the Clearances, the land quality deteriorated and native woodland was reduced at a much more rapid rate. Upland fertility encouraged by the shielings was degraded by the year-round presence of sheep and deer. Gordon suggests that a reintroduction of the shielings system, or an ancient future for Highland hills, could allow for local cheese and meat production as well as rewilding and agroforestry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Scotland, while we undeniably have a meaningful relationship with land and sea, colonial patterns of land ownership and the current pro-growth agenda of oil extraction, rapid urbanisation, and increasing consumption entail the use and abuse of nature, rather than an approach that integrates the health of humanity with the health of the planet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What, then, is our recourse to living holistically and sustainably with and for nature?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The concept of the Commons exists across cultures. Enough! Scotland defines the Commons as \u201cthat which we all share that should be nurtured in the present and passed on, undiminished, to future generations. We might think of reclaiming the Commons as reclaiming our past and our future.\u201d In the Maya K\u2019iche language, the <em>cuchubal <\/em>means \u201cwe all contribute.\u201d In Mayan communities throughout Central America, the tradition of the <em>cuchubal <\/em>entails monthly contributions to a common pool. Historically, this meant each family provided a different foodstuff \u2013 corn, black bean, squash \u2013 so all were provided for. Women led the process. Now, it usually involves the exchange of money as part of a microfinance sharing circle. Sharing circles, then, function like mycorrhizal networks; interconnected and interdependent groups of mutual exchange that act locally in order to ensure the health of the whole. The co-operation and collectivism of the <em>cuchubal<\/em> reflects the Commons and its reclamation of our past and future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Arturo Escobar\u2019s book, <em>Designs for the Pluriverse: Radical Interdependence, Autonomy and the Making of Worlds<\/em>, (5) he suggests that ancestrality is the basis for autonomy. Ancestrality is an energising connection that people have to land through the knowledge that it was inhabited and cared for by their ancestors. Crucially, \u201cfar from being an intransigent attachment to the past, ancestrality stems from a living memory directly connected to the ability to envision a different future\u201d (p.71).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ancestrality acknowledges that other worlds exist and are possible. Wall Kimmerer mentions a \u201cpolyculture of complementary knowledges\u201d, while Escobar defines the \u201cpluriverse\u201d as a plurality of stories that weave together both interdependence and autonomy. This diversity of cultures, identities, languages, food systems, and cosmovisions reflects the Zapatista decolonial, anti-capitalist, agroecologist, and equitable social theory of <em>un mundo donde quepan muchos mundos <\/em>\u2013 \u201ca world where many worlds fit.\u201d Zapatistas say that this ideology serves as a bridge to cross to the other side, to build a better world \u2013 a new world. Radical transformation involves a horizontalised system of mutual aid and reciprocal relations. It involves constructing, not destroying; to serve others, not oneself; to work from below, not supplant from above.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A new world does not entail invention of a new set of stories. It necessitates the revisiting of ancestrality and autonomy in order to achieve a world of many worlds, a world of complementary knowledges and mycorrhizal networks. Decoloniality moves us away from the notion that there is one single story and reinstates a celebration of diverse ways of living in and interacting with the world around us. While colonial forces imposed one single form of living, decolonial ideas encourage a plurality of co-existences; a community grounded in the celebration of difference.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robin Wall Kimmerer writes that while humans can\u2019t photosynthesise and create gifts through air, light, and water \u2013 we do possess language as \u201can act of reciprocity with the living land. Words to remember old stories, words to tell new ones, stories that bring science and spirit back together to nurture our becoming people made of corn\u201d (p.347). In the Mayan sacred text, the <em>Popul Vuh<\/em>, people are born from corn, which in turn is made out of all four elements of earth, air, fire, and water.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIn the indigenous view, humans are viewed as somewhat lesser beings in the democracy of species\u2026 Plants were here first and have had a long time to figure things out. They live both above and below ground and hold the earth in place. Plants know how to make food from light and water. Not only do they feed themselves, but they make enough to sustain the lives of all the rest of us. Plants are providers for the rest of the community and exemplify the virtue of generosity always offering food. What if Western scientists saw plants as their teachers rather than their subjects? What if they told stories with that lens?\u201d (p.346)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The story we might tell is one of reciprocity between people and planet and between past and future. We can learn from plants and the ways they provide, collaborate, and exchange.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Holistic agroecological food systems require a decolonial approach that is circular, decentralised, collective, collaborative, autonomous, and include ancestral wisdoms. In this way, we can achieve a vision for the future that encourages mycorrhizal growing networks in which our communities relocalise, horizontalise, and thrive, in which the complex plurality inherent in our biodiverse ecosystems is defended, celebrated, and protected. And ultimately, in this way, we can transition to the Zapatista epistemological vision of \u201cun mundo donde quepan muchos mundos\u201d \u2013 a world where many worlds fit \u2013 worlds of thriving small-scale crops, reclaimed spaces, localised food systems, and co-operative communities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>To hear more about the work of Nourish Scotland\u2019s Fork to Farm Dialogues and the Glasgow Community Food Network, check out <\/em>UN House Scotland\u2019s Climate and Gender podcast series<em> \u2018Connecting Women\u2019s Voices on Climate Justice\u2019, (6) and have a listen to the second episode, From Scotland to Ecuador: Building Local Relationships for Healthy and Resilient Food Systems.<\/em> (7)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notes<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>\u00a0Suzanne Simard (2021) <em>Finding the Mother Tree: Uncovering the Wisdom and Intelligence of the Forest<\/em>.
