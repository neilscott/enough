	<description>Enough! is an informal collective of activists in Scotland who have come together to take action on challenging our dominant economic system. We believe that inequality, oppression, injustice, power and ecological breakdown are all connected by the same story:</description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Enough!
I read your statement. It is so reassuring to find other people who think this way! Great demands. I am glad that your letter promotes a better valuing of care work (I would add all the unpaid reproductive labour that is the most exploited resource of capitalism, since it is what makes it possible for workers to turn up day after day, as well as providing generations of new workers  through childbearing and rearing.) Please have a look at this global demand for Care Income Now (linked as my contact website). 
I am wondering in talking about needing to connect different projects working towards change, what role are you looking to play? 
There are so many new movements springing up. Are you aware of Common Weal? This group has made a detailed plan of what needs to happen to end Scotland&#039;s reliance on fossil fuels and extractive imports, while expanding local sustainable industries such as forestry and all together eradicating the issue of underemployment by training workers to take up the challenges of a whole energy system overhaul and housing to become better insulated on a national scale. 
Just Green Recovery are also doing work on connecting projects to #build back better (demanding societal transformation to sustainable system, after the corona virus) - This also closely matches your rhetoric of &#039;business as usual&#039; is not an option to go back to. 
Would be great to hear if you are connected to these initiatives. 
  
Another thing to mention is local struggles - there is Mossmorran Action Group and Climate Camp Scotland are organising together to shut down the Exxon production plant in Fife. I can send you more info if you are interested. 
In co-operation,
