Hi Ben –

Thank you for taking time to respond to my questions. There are some threads here I&#039;d love to take further, but I&#039;m about to go offline for the holidays so I&#039;ll have to let it go for now.

As you might have gathered, your post sent me off into a few days of reading and reflecting around the history and implications of the Green New Deal, one result of which was this week&#039;s essay in the Notes From Underground series I&#039;ve been writing for Bella Caledonia:

https://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2019/12/19/notes-from-underground-6-the-salvage-work/

I wrote that before I&#039;d had your reply to the questions I posted here, and you&#039;ll see that I&#039;ve used some passages in your post as a way to structure my own reflections. I hope I haven&#039;t been unfair in my reading of what you wrote – and I hope we&#039;ll have chance to carry on the conversation, there or here, in the new year.

Meanwhile, one piece I came across in my reading stood out, and helped me to get clearer about some of the concerns I&#039;ve been trying to articulate – so in case you haven&#039;t come across it already, I highly recommend this from Nicholas Beuret:

Thanks again for getting me thinking.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enough.scot/what-is-the-big-green-new-deal/#comment-130&quot;&gt;Dougald Hine&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Douglald, thanks for this thoughtful comment.

Ok, three things: De-growth, Socialism, Extinction Rebellion.

1) De-growth: I think there is a general awareness that the Green New Deal can&#039;t be a green version of the New Deal. I think the reason why it originally got the New Deal tag was because it was an idea that  started getting picked up when the 2008 crash was being compared to the 1930s, and there was a debate about what to do about it. And it&#039;s also that think of a national mission: I think that&#039;s where moon landing etc comes in to, it&#039;s that sense of trying to turn climate action into a defining goal for society to mobilise around. But as I say in the article, GND economics are heterogenous, there are those that are committed de-growthers, those who are opposed to that approach and believe there is such a thing as green growth, and those that are more ambivalent about the question, and think the focus should be not on growth or de-growth but on what we value, and whether that generates growth or not is not an important (or as important) a metric. The economist Kate Raworth falls into the latter camp, see here for instance: https://oxfamblogs.org/fp2p/why-degrowth-has-out-grown-its-own-name-guest-post-by-kate-raworth/ I&#039;m inclined towards this position, though I don&#039;t pretend to be an expert in this area. I think we have to explicitly resist attempts, like that of Ursula Von Der Leyen in the European Commission&#039;s European Green Deal, to directly link the Green New Deal to a growth strategy for Europe, but at the same time I think it&#039;s wrong to assume the Green New Deal to be about growth or de-growth, it&#039;s about something much better and more concrete: a plan for rapid decarbonisation. That will include inevitably shrinking some sectors (eradicating fossil fuel extraction altogether) while at the same time growing others (e.g. we need to hire lots of people who can fit district heating systems all over the country). This is the concreteness the GND needs to bring to the climate action movement: not growth or de-growth, but a specific plan for rapid de-carbonisation. I&#039;m not convinced that we do really need to have a philosophical discussion with the public about whether the global economy needs to shrink or not - I think it&#039;s the wrong way to frame the problem because it doesn&#039;t inspire and it doesn&#039;t get to the heart of the issue. 

2) Socialism: I think the traditions of socialism are very diverse. Clearly Stalinist socialism was about state-level planning to grow the industrial base each year so the USSR could compete with the US in the Cold War. But, thankfully, I don&#039;t think that&#039;s what most of us mean by socialism today. The reason why I would argue it&#039;s not fundamentally tied to unsustainable logics like capitalism is that under capitalist economic development the surplus the bottom line is profitability. That mean&#039;s there&#039;s a structural imperative towards accumulation at the enterprise-level, which fosters a growth dynamic at the macro level, as enterprises have to accumulate more than rivals to compete. The whole notion of socialism as I understand is that the bottom line of economic development is socially defined. And eco-socialism means we can define it to meet the goal of planetary sustainability. If there is better language for explaining that simple idea I don&#039;t know what it is.

3) I think Extinction Rebellion has been hugely important, though I see it as one part of three key elements that have emerged over the past year, the other two being Fridays for Future and the Green New Deal movement around AOC in the US. I agree with you that these things don&#039;t have to be in conflict - there is certainly a place for direct action - but where I would place my emphasis is on building a movement that can be universal in its politics, in the sense that it should have an appeal to the whole of society. I think that&#039;s the movement&#039;s that ultimately win. Don&#039;t get me wrong, you still need to be critical and attack and be negative when it&#039;s necessary and when the opportunity is there to do so in a way that puts governments under pressure, but ultimately you need to have a universal appeal, which I&#039;m not sure XR has. 

That was a bit longer than I intended! Thanks again, it&#039;s helped me clarify my thoughts.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ben –

Thanks for this very helpful summary of the state of things with the Green New Deal – and for the work behind it. You&#039;ve given me a better grasp of where we stand.

One question I&#039;d appreciate your thoughts on, given how deeply you&#039;ve gone into this stuff. You note that &#039;there is a need to reduce global economic output&#039;. Based on your reading, how far is there an understanding of the necessity of &#039;degrowth&#039; within the spectrum of Green New Deals? 

Invoking the original New Deal brings up connotations of a massive state-backed programme of infrastructure building – this represents a break with neoliberalism, but that&#039;s not the same thing as recognising the need for degrowth. I guess my concern is that part of the appeal of GND is that the reference point is a mid-20th century mixed economy (WWII, the moon landings), which the left can easily get nostalgic about – and which may postpone more difficult conversations about degrowth. (After all, one of the arguments levelled at neoliberalism is that the post-70s era has seen significantly lower annual rates of GDP growth than the post-war decades.)

Coming from the left, I&#039;m nonetheless uneasy with the idea that climate change simply validates positions that most of us would be arguing for anyway. It seems to me that the socialism that has come down to us was formed as much by the logics of an unsustainable industrial model of society (and the struggle to humanise that society) as the capitalism against which it has struggled.

Finally, when you write about the importance of telling &#039;a positive story&#039;, it seems worth pausing for a moment, given that you also acknowledge the role played by Extinction Rebellion. Because I remember exactly this argument being directed at XR in October 2018, explaining why their approach wouldn&#039;t work – and they went on to achieve a mobilisation around climate change whose impact has exceeded anything I can think of in the UK in the last 30 years. There are plenty of valid criticisms to be made of XR, but it seems to me that their ability to mobilise activism from a place &#039;beyond hope&#039; has a power which goes deeper than the pitch that we can &#039;save the world . . . and make all of our lives better in the process&#039;. And, as you say, the effect of this mobilisation is supportive of and not in conflict with the direction of travel represented by the GND.

I don&#039;t mean to be polemical in voicing these questions and misgivings. I&#039;m wrestling with this stuff myself – and keen to see what light your reading around the GND might shed on it all. When I&#039;ve been asked about the emergence of GND over the past year, my answer has been that, even if I&#039;m right in my misgivings, the movement of the Overton Window which these developments represent is in the direction it needs to move in, if we&#039;re to have the conversations I would want to be having.]]></description>
