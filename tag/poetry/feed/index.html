<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Before the Trauma</strong></h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">by Justin Kenrick</h4>



<p>1</p>



<p>Before
the trauma</p>



<p>was
the tiny palm</p>



<p>searching
for love, 
</p>



<p>embodying
love. 
</p>



<p>In
the beginning 
</p>



<p>was
connection 
</p>



<p>and
emergence:</p>



<p>knowing
nothing,</p>



<p>embodying
everything. 
</p>



<p>2.</p>



<p>The
trauma 
</p>



<p>of
the ‘you not me, 
</p>



<p>me
not you’ world</p>



<p>was
nowhere 
</p>



<p>in
the ‘me because you, 
</p>



<p>you
because me’ world. 
</p>



<p>3.</p>



<p>Does
outing the trauma</p>



<p>drive
it deeper? 
</p>



<p>Or
open us</p>



<p>to
healing whole?</p>



<p>What
makes for fearing to speak?</p>



<p>What
makes for fearing to feel? 
</p>



<p>What
makes for “I’m right, You’re wrong”?</p>



<p>What
makes for “I’m wrong, You’re wrong”?</p>



<p>4.</p>



<p>Must
we be thrown</p>



<p>scraps
of silence,</p>



<p>or
eat our words?</p>



<p>5.</p>



<p>Trauma
sits by the fire in its cave,</p>



<p>terrified
of the huge shadows it casts,</p>



<p>thinking
fear and terror are the only company.</p>



<p>“Safe
here” it thinks,</p>



<p>where
none can hurt</p>



<p>because
there is no one</p>



<p>and
nothing but hurt. 
</p>



<p>6.</p>



<p>Step
out into the big field of unknowing</p>



<p>where
we can touch our sadness.</p>



<p>It
is bitter out here</p>



<p>where
violence tears the world by the throat.</p>



<p>It
is sweet out here</p>



<p>
where kindness searches out kindness, keening in
song,</p>



<p>searching
for he how of honesty and love,</p>



<p>we
stumble across each other’s hopes and fears</p>



<p>asking
for forgiveness,</p>



<p>offering
gratitude, 
</p>



<p>making
mistakes,</p>



<p>getting
cross.</p>



<p>7.</p>



<p>There
is nowhere else to go,</p>



<p>no
one else to love 
</p>



<p>in
syllables of fury 
</p>



<p>or
words of care.</p>



<p>Here
by the hearth of 
</p>



<p>roaring
flame, subdued embers, bitter ash 
</p>



<p>we
are the earth hurting, hearting, healing.</p>



<p>Stretched
taught 
</p>



<p>by
the pain</p>



<p>of
being 
</p>



<p>divided
from each other,</p>



<p>and
being one.</p>
