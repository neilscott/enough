<h4 class="wp-block-heading"> <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/130908-anna-hibiscus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anna Hibiscus – Atinuke</a></strong>, 6 years+</h4>



<p>There  are many, many Anna Hibiscus books both as picture books and short,  early reader chapter books. Written by Nigerian-born  story teller Atinuke, the stories follow a young child, Anna Hibiscus  on her adventures. Anna is part of a mixed race family living in  “amazing Africa”. The same author has written amonther series called  “The No.1 Car Spotter” which follows Oluwalase Babatunde Benson, the no.1 car spotter in his rural village in an undisclosed country in Africa. Both series of  books are light-hearted and fun and ideal as first chapter books to read alone.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/275966-agent-zaiba-investigates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Agent Zaiba Investigates – Annabelle Sami,</a> 6 years+</h4>



<p>Ideal for new readers, the  text in this story is broken up with numerous illustrations. Zaiba loves  to find an excuse to practise being a proper  detective so when some diamonds go missing from her cousin’s henna  party, she springs into action. A very energetic adventure set in a  British Pakistani family.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36635202-lightning-girl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lightening Girl – Alesha Dixon, 8 years+</a></h4>



<p>Part of a series of books  about 10 year old Aurora Beam who discovers she has secret powers whilst  sticking up for her little sister in the school  playground. She later learns her mum is secretly a superhero and has to  work out how to balance her everyday life with her newfound powers.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/41710162-asha-the-spirit-bird" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Asha and the Spirit Bird – Jasbinder Bilan</a>, 8 years+</h4>



<p>The story follows a young  girl, Asha, travelling from her home in the foothills of the Himalayas  to find her father who has gone to earn some money  in a far off city. The subject matter is dark at times but the tone is  constantly reassuring and has a magical, fairy tales quality. </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39884333-the-boy-at-the-back-of-the-class" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Boy at The Back Of The Class – Onjali Q Rauf</a>, 8 years +</h4>



<p>Told from the perspective of a  9-and-nearly-three-quarter year old, The Boy at The Back of the Class  follows four friend who tried to befriend and  then help the enigmatic new boy who sits at the back of their class.  This book expertly explores difficult issues around the refugee crisis,  losing a parent and navigating the confusing world of politics in an  entirely age appropriate way. There is such humour  and tenderness throughout.</p>



<p>For upper primary, many of  the books featuring characters of colour, disabled characters and LGBT  characters are issues based. While this can be  helpful, it’s also necessary for children to read stories with diverse  characters not simple overcoming barriers. My children have found that  crime fiction is one genre that seems to do well in terms of  representation so our recommendations are quite weighted  towards detective stories. </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1184305.The_London_Eye_Mystery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The London Eye Mystery – Siobhan Dowd</a>, 9 years+</h4>



<p>In The London Eye Mystery, a  brother and sister investigative team try to work out how their cousin  took a ride on the London Eye and never came  off again. The story focuses on the plot rather than the leader  character’s Asperger’s diagnosis. </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31176543-the-guggenheim-mystery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Guggenheim Mystery – Robin Stevens</a>, 9 years+</h4>



<p>The same cousin and siblings team of Kat, Ted and Salim from the The  London Eye Mystery appear in the Guggenheim Mystery where Ted’ Aunt  Gloria is framed for the theft of a painting from the museum. The  children set off to crack the case and prevent their aunt  from being sent to prison. </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42777875-high-rise-mystery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">High Rise Mystery – Sharna Jackson</a>, 9 years+</h4>



<p>This is the first in a series  of whodunnit mysteries set in The Tri, a high-rise in London told from  the perspective of an 11 year old. Our detectives  are Nik and Norva, two black sisters, following clues to solve the  crime.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="http://www.alexgino.com/george/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">George – Alex Gino</a>, 10 years+</h4>



<p>Melissa wants to play Charlotte in her school’s production of Charlotte’s Web. But as a closeted trans girl, her teachers don’t
 understand why, and won’t let her. She and her best friend Kelly hatch a plan.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12980968-jasmine-skies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Artichoke Hearts and Jasmine Skies – Sita Bramachari</a>, 11 years+</h4>



<p>Artichoke Hearts and its sequel, Jasmine Skies, follow Mira, a  mixed-race child in London entering puberty and navigating the  challenges that come with it. Friendship, romance, a bereavement and  getting to know family in India are explored with real tenderness.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/714902.Noughts_Crosses" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Noughts and Crosses – Malorie Blackman</a>, 12 years+</h4>



<p>Malorie Blackman has written numerous books with  BAME characters for new readers to young adults but her most well-known  series, and most likely to be found in any high school library is the  Noughts and Crosses series. The population is divided into two: the white Noughts are second-class  citizens, and the black Crosses are highly-revered and perceived as the  superior race. 15-year-old Callum is a Nought, and his best friend,  Sephy, as well as being a Cross, is also the daughter  of one of the most influential politicians in the country. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32075671-the-hate-u-give" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Hate U Give – Angie Thomas</a>, 12 years+</h4>



<p>Although recommended for 12 years+ this is a great book for adults to  read too. Starr is the only witness to her friend, Khalil’s murder by a  police officers. She has to decide whether to use her voice to fight for  justice and at what cost. A brilliant exploration  of race in America.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35887567-on-the-come-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On the Come up – Angie Thomas</a>, 12 years+</h4>



<p>On the Come Up&nbsp;is
 an inspiring coming-of-age story following Bri, an aspiring rapper, 
daughter of a murdered father, living in a tough American neighbourhood.
 At school, she’s been defined as &#8220;trouble&#8221; and her mum, a former drug 
addict, is struggling to pay the bills after
 losing her job. Life is tough and when Bri records her first rap full 
of anger and guns, it goes viral for all the wrong reasons.
</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/41012355-oh-my-gods" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oh My Gods – Alexandra Sheppard</a>, 12 years+</h4>



<p>Helen had expected a 
few &#8220;settling in&#8221; issues when she moved south to live with her dad, but 
actually her new school is great and she makes
 friends almost straightaway. It’s her family that are the problem. 
They are all ancient Greek gods. 
Although the book is essentially witty and slightly absurd, it deals 
with challenges and experiences that many young people can identify with
 and celebrates diversity and individuality.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/45730968-this-book-is-anti-racist" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This Book is Anti-Racist – Tiffany Jewell</a>, 12 years+</h4>



<p>This
 book is written for the young person who doesn&#8217;t know how to speak up 
to the racist adults in their life.
 Written by&nbsp;anti-bias, anti-racist, educator&nbsp;and activist, Tiffany 
Jewell, and illustrated&nbsp;by French illustrator Aurélia Durand, it is 
heavly illustrated, colourful and easy to digest. It is written so 
children and young adults will feel empowered to stand
 up to the adults who continue to close doors in their faces. This book 
will give them&nbsp;the language and ability to understand racism and a drive
 to undo it.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45998171-i-will-not-be-erased" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I will Not Be Erased – gal-dem</a>, 13 years+</h4>



<p>Fourteen joyous, funny and life-affirming essays from gal-dem, the award-winning magazine created by young
 women and non-binary people of colour. I wish I could’ve read this as a young person of colour growing up in Britain.</p>



<p>
The Million Pieces of Neela Gill – Emma Smith-Barton, 13 years+</p>



<p>The Million Pieces of Neena Gill&nbsp;is
 a moving portrait of a clever, talented girl who is gradually falling 
apart and losing her grip on reality, but doesn’t realise it. The story 
is seen entirely through Neena’s eyes, so the reader only discovers 
what’s actually going on in her life ‘in real
 time’.&nbsp;Despite the underlying tragedy,&nbsp;It
is ultimately a powerful, uplifting story of family, love, grief and getting through very difficult times.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25699515-orangeboy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orangeboy – Patrice Lawrence</a>, 14 years+</h4>



<p>This is a gritty, urban mystery touching on the 
dangerous reality of drug pushing and young people being forced into 
dealing. It’s a pacey, crime thriller looking at serious issues without 
preaching.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34728667-children-of-blood-and-bone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Children of Blood and Bone &#8211; Tomi Adeyemi</a>, 14 years+</h4>



<p>Magic
 has gone from the world, vanished when Zelie’s mother was violently 
murdered by the King’s men. Now the Maji clans, marked
 out by their silver hair, live in constant fear. Zelie longs to rebel, 
but her chance doesn’t come until she finds herself having to protect a 
runaway princess, Amari, who is carrying a scroll that can bring magic 
back to the world. A thriller set in a fantasy
 world based on African tradition.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/34946853-a-change-is-gonna-come" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Change is Gonna Come – collection of short stories</a>, 13 years+</h4>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Ms Marvel, Spiderman (Miles Moralis) and a number of other Marvel superheroes.</h4>



<p>A smattering of Marvel superheroes in the last five years have been racially diverse,  well-rounded, complex characters. My personal favourite is  Kamila Khan as Ms Marvel, a second-generation Pakistani American  teenager in New Jersey trying, as so many Marvel heroes do, to work out  how to use her powers effectively whilst staying true to herself and her  family’s culture.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/131068-lumberjanes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lumberjanes</a></h4>



<p>Jo, 
April, Mal, Molly and Ripley are five best pals determined to have fun 
and adventures together. Featuring supernatural
 elements, gender non-conforming and queer characters plus racial 
diversity all wrapped up in stories about quests and friendships. This 
is a growing series of comics and spin-offs.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28953805-goldie-vance-vol-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goldie Vance</a></h4>



<p>A series of comics featuring a Black, queer, teenage detective solving mysteries.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://imagecomics.com/comics/releases/moonstruck-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moonstruck</a></h4>



<p>Julie  is shy and just wants to enjoy a date with her new girlfriend Selena.  When a magician casts a horrifying spell on their  friend Chet they team up with the rest of their magical community to  stop the magician before he can steal more magic. Oh, Julie and Selena  are also werewolves, but that doesn’t define them.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3061046/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steven Universe</a></h4>



<p>In Steven Universe the world is protected from evil by the Crystal gems who have escaped from  Homeworld because they were unable to live under the  strict world order imposed by the Diamonds who rule it. As well as  excellent representation, this programme has great music with each of  the main characters assuming a different musical genre. Although there  are battles between the ‘good’ and ‘evil’ forces,  ultimately the only way to win in Steven Universe is through emotional  growth and understanding. </p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7745956/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">She-ra and the Princesses of Power</a></h4>



<p>A contemporary re-make of the  80’s classic, She-Ra and the Princesses of Power is an openly queer  cartoon for children of all ages that eschews  binaries of all kinds. Even the treatment of good vs’ evil is nuanced  and, as with in Steven Universe, emotional growth is what all the  characters are constantly working towards. </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1825683/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Panther</a></h4>



<p>Set in Wakanda, a small, isolationist, landlocked country in Africa. Two foes conspire to destroy it and superhero Black Panther works with special forces from Wakanda and USA to try and prevent it from being dragged into a world war. Unaccustomed as we are to a majority black cast in a  Hollywood action movie, this film is a such a treat in giving viewers a  range of complex, three-dimensional, Black characters  to watch as well as exploring themes of colonialism and generational  trauma.  </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298228/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whale Rider</a></h4>



<p>Whale Rider tells the story  of a young Maori girl, Pai, who challenges tradition and embraces the  past in order to find the strength to lead her  people forward. Beautifully shot and with incredible performances from  the cast, this is such a wonderful film for children and adults alike.</p>
