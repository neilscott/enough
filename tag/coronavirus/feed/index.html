<p><em>This statement by the degrowth.info editorial team is helpful as the Enough Collective and climate activists (and all of us) continue to get our heads around the current crisis. </em></p>



<p><em>Degrowth advocates for a general slowdown and large emissions reductions, minus the pandemic and social distress.</em></p>



<p>The coronavirus (covid-19) has caused upheaval across the world, 
deaths of the most vulnerable, closed borders, financial market crashes,
 curfews and controls on group gatherings, and many more devastating 
effects.</p>



<p>Despite observations that <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51944780" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pollution and emissions have reduced</a>, the sudden, un-planned, and chaotic downscaling of social and economic activity due to covid-19 is categoraically <em>not </em>degrowth.
 Instead, it’s an example of why degrowth is needed; it shows the 
unsustainability and fragility of our current way of life. Additionally,
 the response to covid-19 has shown that degrowth is possible, because 
society (and the state) has demonstrated an ability to dramatically 
change the modus operandi in response to a major crisis.</p>



<p>This article will consider these three points in further detail: the 
covid-19 crisis is not degrowth, how covid-19 shows that degrowth is 
needed, and why covid-19 shows the potential for a societal 
transformation to a degrowth future.</p>



<p><strong>This crisis is not degrowth.</strong></p>



<p>Just because covid-19, like an economically triggered recession, has 
resulted in a downscaling of production, transport, and emissions 
amongst other things, this does not mean it represents degrowth. 
Firstly, a degrowth transformation must be intentional and democratic.</p>



<p>Secondly, degrowth requires a long-term commitment to the downscaling
 of production and consumption as well as the reorganization of society 
in a different and more just way.</p>



<p>Thirdly, covid-19 has so far disproportionately affected the most 
vulnerable in society; not only the very old and young, but also workers
 who don’t have the option of paid remote work and so must face the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/14/coronavirus-outbreak-inequality-austerity-pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trade-off between risky infection at work or staying at home awaiting unpayable bills</a>. In the U.S., expensive health care bills and the general lack of coverage, are <a href="https://qz.com/1809382/us-health-care-costs-could-help-coronavirus-spread/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likely going to cause the virus to spread&nbsp; further,</a>
 amongst uninsured and low-income people. Globally, some of the most 
vulnerable are refugees trapped in inadequate facilities, exemplified by
 <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2020/03/14/immediate-evacuation-of-migrant-camps-in-greece-needed-to-contain-coronavirus-says-msf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the disaster waiting to unfold on the Greek island of Lesbos</a>.
 Something tells us the rich aren’t struggling to find hand sanitizer 
and toilet paper, or dying in hospitals from lack of treatment.</p>



<p>In summary, a degrowth transformation would be intentional and 
proactively pursued, and have justice and equality at its core. None of 
this is the case in the current situation.</p>



<p><strong>Covid-19 shows that degrowth is needed.</strong></p>



<p>The current crisis highlights the unsustainability of our current 
system. If a flu can cause such upheaval throughout our entire social 
and economic system, then we should probably consider different and 
better ways to organize our societies. Our current political-economic 
system is incapable of responding to the crisis in a just and humane 
way. For example, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/g7-leaders-to-do-whatever-necessary-to-fight-coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the G7’s recent statement</a> on the crisis portrays ‘the economy’ as an equal, if not greater, priority than social well-being:</p>



<p><em>“we will work to resolve the health and economic risks caused by 
the COVID-19 pandemic and set the stage for a strong recovery of strong,
 sustainable economic growth and prosperity”</em></p>



<p>Thus, an alternative political-economic system is needed. One that is
 more resilient, just, and explicitly prioritizes human (and non-human) 
well-being over economic growth. We will explore here some of the causes
 of covid-19, the structural mechanisms that have exacerbated it, and 
consider how this would be different in a degrowth society.</p>



<p>Covid-19 originated from a <a href="https://theecologist.org/2020/feb/04/eating-animals-will-be-death-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">‘live-animal market’</a>, where over 100 types of wild and domesticated animals are kept in close proximity and killed in front of customers. Like <a href="https://www.plantbasednews.org/opinion/carnivores-coronavirus-end-of-the-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many pandemics before it</a>,
 covid-19 entered the human population through the killing and 
consumption of animals. Initially then, a society in which animals were 
treated with more care rather than as commodities to be exploited and 
consumed would reduce the risk of pandemics such as covid-19. On this 
note,<a href="https://www.degrowth.info/en/2020/02/degrowth-and-animal-liberation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> some </a><a href="https://www.degrowth.info/en/2020/02/degrowth-and-animal-liberation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">degrowth advocates have argued for animal liberation</a>. A strong case can be made that it is the <a href="https://climateandcapitalism.com/2020/03/11/capitalist-agriculture-and-covid-19-a-deadly-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global capitalist industrial agri-food system</a>
 in particular that creates the kind of conditions that allow for the 
increased occurrence of viruses and their potential to spread.</p>



<p>The occurrence (and spread) of viruses like covid-19 is also greatly 
exacerbated by highly dense living. Cities have been growing in size and
 numbers since the agrarian revolution and continue unchecked up until 
the present. Larger and denser cities are a consequence of out-migration
 from the declining countryside due to a lack of employment 
opportunities, economic and transport policies that favor the center 
over the periphery, and a culture that fetishizes the lifestyle and 
opportunities of the big city. Meanwhile, a degrowth transformation 
would emphasize the importance of community-based economic activity, 
re-prioritize essential work such as growing food, re-value proximity to
 nature, and demonstrate the possibilities for a multi-cultural, 
diverse, and socially-rich life outside of big cities.</p>



<p>The economic fallout following the breakdown of global supply chains –
 notably the abrupt closing of factories in China – highlights what the 
Brookings Institute (a conservative thinktank) describe as “<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2020/03/05/the-coronavirus-will-reveal-hidden-vulnerabilities-in-complex-global-supply-chains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hidden vulnerabilities</a>”. Similarly, the Harvard Business Review is calling for <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/03/coronavirus-is-proving-that-we-need-more-resilient-supply-chains" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more resilient supply chains</a>, and Foreign Policy is saying firms like Apple have been “<a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/04/blindsided-on-the-supply-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blindsided on the supply side</a>.” It’s almost like the business pundits and consultants are suddenly waking up to the craziness of an economic system where <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/where-is-the-iphone-made-1999503" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an iPhone requires parts from dozens of countries</a>, <a href="https://time.com/46777/your-data-is-dirty-the-carbon-price-of-cloud-computing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">‘the cloud’ is dirty</a>
 and devours a huge amount of energy to support your streaming needs, 
and where those pretty white boxes embody lots of (exploited) human 
labor. Degrowth proposes to re-localize a significant amount of 
production based on <a href="https://www.degrowth.info/en/2019/09/liberatory-potential-local-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bio-regionalism</a><a href="https://www.degrowth.info/en/2019/09/liberatory-potential-local-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">,</a> shortening supply chains and increasing their resilience through transparency and decentralization.</p>



<p>Lastly, it is true that human settlements have experienced fatal 
epidemics for much longer than the existence of capitalism as we know it
 today. However, our hyper-mobile and interconnected global capitalist 
societies have exacerbated the spread of covid-19 through<a href="https://www.wsj.com/graphics/how-the-coronavirus-spread/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> frequent </a><a href="https://www.wsj.com/graphics/how-the-coronavirus-spread/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long-distance </a>travel, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_on_cruise_ships" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive cruise ships</a>, and short-distance flights (for example from <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/belgium-bans-events-with-over-1000-people-due-to-coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Belgium to Italy for ski vacations</a>).
 Covid-19 has grounded our hyper-mobility to a halt. We’re forced to 
stay rooted, and maybe it’s a moment to reflect on why we constantly 
feel compelled in contemporary society to be always on-the-go, be it 
from one activity to the next or from one continent to another for a 5 
day holiday.</p>



<p>While the reasons for ‘slowing down’ are different for covid-19 
(reducing the spread of infection) and degrowth (e.g. reducing the <a href="https://www.wri.org/blog/2020/02/greenhouse-gas-emissions-by-country-sector" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global emissions from transport</a>),
 both lead us to a similar reflection: perhaps we can be content 
spending much more of our time at home with family and friends, in our 
communities and moving more slowly and mindfully.</p>



<p><strong>Covid-19 shows degrowth is possible</strong></p>



<p>Planning, economic regulation, limiting certain social behaviors, 
high-levels of community cooperation and a slowing down of life (of 
course not for all, but for many), have all been responses to covid-19, 
and demonstrate the need for a re-evaluation of our way of life. Similar
 measures were labeled ‘politically impossible’ and ‘unrealistic’ in the
 context of climate and other social crises, yet today they are reality 
in China, across all of Europe, and now the rest of the world.</p>



<p>Covid-19, like any crisis, highlights the potential for transformative action (and change) when society <em>decides</em>
 the crisis warrants discarding the previous bounds of normalcy. The 
signs of this are already here. For example, there are popular online 
petitions in Germany and the UK calling for a universal basic income to 
be implemented in order to protect those threatened by job loss and 
poverty due to covid-19.</p>



<p>Climate change is expected to cause approximately <a href="https://www.who.int/globalchange/publications/quantitative-risk-assessment/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">250,000 additional deaths per year between 2030 and 2050</a>;
 38,000 due to heat exposure in elderly people, 48,000 due to diarrhoea,
 60,000 due to malaria, and 95,000 due to childhood undernutrition. Yet 
society has not been so quick to take meaningful action. An abhorrent 
reality is that part of the reason for inaction in wealthy nations is 
likely because, as the same report shows “the burden of disease from 
climate change in the future will continue to fall mainly on children in
 developing countries”.</p>



<p>This is why it is important to acknowledge the climate crisis as 
being exactly that: an unfolding catastrophe requiring an urgent and 
drastic systemic response. Degrowth provides a way forward.</p>



<p><strong>From analysis to action</strong></p>



<p>Whilst the current slow-down of economic activity may have some 
analogies with degrowth, this is clearly not the societal transformation
 we are struggling for. Instead, the crisis shows the failure of the 
current political-economic system and its inadequacies in dealing with 
such crises in a humane and just way. Degrowth offers a more resilient, 
just, and sustainable alternative way of organising society.</p>



<p>Most encouraging of all, the current crisis highlights the <em>potential </em>for
 a degrowth transformation across all scales of society. States are 
planning, regulating and being challenged, communities are creating 
mutual support networks, and individuals are radically adjusting their 
way of living.</p>



<p>On the other hand, there is clearly a historical precedent for 
right-wing, populist, and neoliberal governments exploiting crises such 
as the current one to re-embed their agenda. In 2008-2009 they enacted 
austerity policies for the majority and bailed out the financial and 
insurance sector (now they are considering saving the airlines).</p>



<p>In an upcoming article, we will consider how the degrowth movement 
(and other social and ecological movements) can counter this tendency 
for crises to be exploited for harmful ends, and consider what 
strategies make sense during the covid-19 crisis.</p>



<p>We send our solidarity to everyone who needs it in this moment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The coronavirus pandemic is a reminder that health is truly a public issue that we must meet with care, courage and a collaborative mindset in order to lessen the impact on everyone, but especially on the hardest hit and most vulnerable members of society.</p>



<p>The best case scenario would be a well-resourced public health system and carefully coordinated responses by our national governments and local authorities that enable us to restructure our daily lives in ways that minimise the risk of infection and ensuing spread of the virus.</p>



<p>This is not our current reality. Years of austerity politics have left the NHS and local authorities woefully underfunded and ill-equipped to meet the demands that the peak of the coronavirus outbreak will bring. The UK Government’s light-handed approach in the hope to increase “herd immunity” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/epidemiologist-britain-herd-immunity-coronavirus-covid-19?CMP=share_btn_fb&amp;fbclid=IwAR1oB1ZsbwDN-m_IzbT0OS5ylIG2-3dgOXpicNw5xJnhTkL1iVar5jlNgKM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been widely criticised by experts</a> and those based in other countries where the outbreak is already more advanced than here. The Scottish Government’s<a href="https://www.gov.scot/news/covid-19-testing-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> introduction of community testing</a> to monitor how the virus spreads to better predict when it is likely to peak is an important move. However, measures to limit the spread of the virus are not yet far-reaching given that we are dealing with a global emergency unfolding at an exponential pace.</p>



<p>We are also very wary of the narrative that there are positive environmental consequences as a result of the coronavirus. Celebrating the carbon reduction brought from the virus distracts us from the kind of systemic change that is desperately needed. We’ve been needing to slow down for a long time:</p>



<p>“What the virus is telling us about our society, our work life, our family life, our systems is this: most of it isn’t designed for humans, it’s designed for capitalism. That’s a profound insight worth holding onto.” &#8211; <a href="https://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2020/03/15/on-isolation-and-recovery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mike Small</a></p>



<p>At this time of social emergency, what can we learn towards making systemic change? We can acknowledge the vital importance of our public services, reflect on the importance of community and human connection, recognise our collective interdependence and be conscious of our creative potential. We can make the most of this time to take stock, to read and learn, to <a href="https://usdac.us/news-long/2020/3/15/community-care-in-the-time-of-coronavirus?fbclid=IwAR27JEIBFgm0mSteqv5U7L9iadGnJ9loX3tv5hz9gP-QB1EY2t2nfqtd9lo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">share resources</a>, to explore, discuss and build alternatives.</p>



<p><strong><em>Together, we are enough. Together, we can find ways to move through times of crisis and beyond. </em></strong></p>



<p>We must now look at routes available to us to strengthen mutual support 
structures for the most vulnerable in society and our public health 
system. Taking collective responsibility is one way in which each of us 
can help to “<a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/dragging-out-the-coronavirus-epidemic-is-important-in-saving-lives" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flatten the curve</a>”
 of the pandemic’s peak in Scotland and the UK, and minimise the impact 
on people needing treatment, and on our overstrained and under resourced
 NHS and its workers.</p>



<p>At Enough!, we have made the decision to move our internal meetings and public-facing events to virtual spaces for the time being. This will cut down on commuting and sharing spaces in close proximity, to slow down the virus outbreak. In terms of our planned outward facing work, this will affect the <a href="https://www.enough.scot/2020/02/24/less-for-lent-give-up-capitalism-for-40-days/">Less for Lent</a> group meet-ups and the launch of <a href="https://www.enough.scot/2019/10/10/less/">Less &#8211; the journal of the Scottish Degrowth Commission, Issue 1</a>, which are both to take place in the coming weeks and which we are now looking to host in virtual spaces. </p>



<p>The decision might also mean prioritising research and development in the coming weeks and maybe months, which won’t affect our publications but has some implications for our community-based work. We will move as much as we possibly can onto virtual platforms, and will share information on how to join and connect with us on a case by case basis.</p>



<p>We recognise that we are lucky to be in a position to take these steps, and we would like to encourage those who can to take similar measures. </p>



<p>We can reframe ‘social distancing’ as an <a href="https://mailchi.mp/c51680b37a33/march-in-mayday-rooms-2682841?e=0b5a67bf1c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">act of solidarity</a> and mutual aid. We recognise that the act of self-isolation may be difficult for many in a world already marked with loneliness, alienation, fear and social insecurity. We would like to set a precedent of care for our friends, neighbours and those around us: we encourage everyone to think about how we can act collectively to protect marginalised and oppressed groups, to connect and deepen community over the next few weeks.</p>



<p>In solidarity and care,<br></p>



<p>Enough!</p>
