<p><strong>&#8220;Across the continent, millions do not recognize themselves in the climate movement.&#8221;</strong><br><br><strong>Green New Deal for Europe, </strong><em><strong>Blue Print for Europe’s Just Transition </strong></em></p>



<p><strong>&#8220;The consumer is essentially somebody who feels, or is made to feel, lost, unless he or she is consuming. Brand names and logos become the place-names of the Nowhere.&#8221;</strong><br><br><strong>John Berger, </strong><em><strong>Ten Dispatches about Place </strong></em></p>



<p>I take the slow train from Berlin to the Polish border in the early morning. On the platform of an eastern suburban station, tired workers wearing puffer jackets and carrying sports bags smoke and chat in quick snatches of mother-tongue — cheerful at the flashes of recognition. We move through a deep mist settled over plains and forests, and then cross a river. On the other side, another train south, that began its journey at the Baltic sea, speeds along with its cargo segmented in the old fashioned six-person compartments. Everyone who enters is obligated to offer a greeting, and bids farewell to everyone else, having shared this warm space for a stretch. They don’t share much detail about what their journeys are for or where they terminate. </p>



<p>I see forests and small hamlets, some of which we stop at. The great smokestacks of coal-fired power, painted in the national colours of red and white, are one of the few notable reminders that a border has been crossed. The raw variety of capitalism that re-shaped Poland after everything changed 30 years ago, and which is now challenged in turn by a winning mix of nationalism, welfarism and social conservatism, dispensed with old-fashioned loyalties to place. Yet people have shifted to-and-fro here for centuries, and perhaps the outflow of workers to the glittering cluster cities westward from Berlin was inevitable. As inevitable as the ten-hour train home, punctuated by excited calls from relatives, the boredom in anticipation, the slumber needed but not to be achieved — the glittering corporate logos triumphant over Berlin Ostbahnhof, still imprinted on heavy eyelids.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>The rolling stock is probably not that much older than I am – like the post-Communist world, coming to terms with moving into its thirties. Yet, not for the first time, I’m reminded as we power along this fully-electrified line, of the peculiar British backwardness about such things. If this rolling stock originates in the Warsaw Pact era, it’s sobering to recall that much of Britain’s rail infrastructure is essentially still Victorian. </p>



<p>Our island is an island, stuck in its ways. Even if, as measured by the dead metric of growth, it outstrips many of these places, it reproduces itself on a loop. The modernity of Britain is absurd and excitable: simply the spectacle of property and wealth rising beyond the grasp of those who traipse above and underground. Modernity in Europe feels older, wrinkled and cranky, like an old barfly. It has lived through a lot more, if we’re honest. The full employment of Communism and its necessary equivalent in the relative comfort of the western social democracies are gone, but the sight of its worn form still lingering reminds those raised in Britain of the social solidarity that we never <em>really </em>had. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>A
few days later, in Katowice, I realise that the taste and smell of coal in a
large industrialised European city isn’t the only feature that makes the past
feel particularly present. </p>



<p>In this city —&nbsp; think of a coal cottonoplis — winding gear, some of which towers over pits still in use, can be seen across the horizon. 80% of Poland’s electricity still comes from coal, with much of it still hauled from below ground by the state-backed firm PGG. Around Katowice they dig hard coal: the good stuff. </p>



<p>At dawn the next morning I see miners in smart black uniforms and plumed caps wake up the residents of the model mining village Nikiszowiec with their brass band. They represent the opposite of the world of Poland post-EU accession, with its migration of millions of Poles abroad in search of work. Their music beats the bounds of the place they have made through their labours. It is the beginning of <em>Barbórka —</em> the feast day of St Barbara — the patron saint of all those who work in trades likely to be suddenly lethal – but here particularly venerated by miners. </p>



<p>The
getting of coal in Poland has long been fundamental to the national story.</p>



<p>There are no illusions here that this bedrock of history can simply be shrugged off. Although hundreds of thousands have left the industry in recent years, mining is still a major employer. But perhaps the way coal has knitted itself into the cultural fabric of Upper Silesia will be more significant in the longer term. Although for many years a debatable territory where the former domains of the great imperial houses of Europe converged — this is also a Polish heartland and coal is fundamental to what that modern nation became. </p>



<p>The miners were embraced by Communist leaders as a model for Soviet-inspired productivism. Edward Gierek, first secretary of the ruling Polish United Workers&#8217; Party throughout the 1970s, told them: “We will always be honoured to award miners for their effort and contribution to the development of our socialist homeland.”</p>



<p>But
despite their relatively privileged place in the system, miners also played a
seminal role in resistance to the authorities Gierek oversaw. Later, I visit
the weighty monument to nine miners killed at the Wujek colliery in 1981, during
a protracted period of strikes and occupations sparked by the regime’s
imposition of martial law, as living standards plummeted.</p>



<p>The bloody confrontation at Wujek was a pivotal moment in Poland’s transition from Communism, showing the significance of Solidarność&#8217;s actions a year after the Gdańsk Agreement. This use of state violence underlined the moral cause of the trade union&#8217;s protracted fight for national liberation, which, despite many compromises, achieved the unprecedented by establishing an autonomous trade union within a totalitarian system. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Across decades of enormous change — as regimes of different ideological and national stripes came and went in Upper Silesia – the heroic figure of the miner has remained a constant. Within this context, the Polish state’s recent opt-out from the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EU Commission’s Green Deal</a> is unsurprising, as is the minimal interest from miners themselves in talking about transition. Since Katowice hosted COP24 last year, many journalists from Western Europe have traipsed here seeking authentic characters agreeable to a rapid shift away from coal. But there is no shortage of people keen to talk about the difficult lived reality of life in a major coal-producing region. Citizens of small towns like Imielin tell me that they are threatened by a very literal undermining: as PGG seeks to expand mining operations a few hundred metres below their homes. The region also has some of the worst air quality on the continent. </p>



<p>This situation speaks to the questions at the forefront of my journey. How could a carbon transition keep hold of the legacy of democratic and social struggles that placed miners, with their unique role in society, in the vanguard? Could a radical Green New Deal re-establish the old proud loyalty to place: that desire for rootedness and community that the global market has robbed from so many? </p>



<p>The disparities around energy use across different EU regions demonstrates, on a more comprehensible scale, the great unspeakable blasphemy that haunts all talk of transition globally — the notion that growth and prosperity might not be part of the bargain. The idea that places where the missionaries of consumerism are still penetrating should not enjoy its promise, because they heard the gospel too late, makes a mockery of what many consider just. It’s easier to casually come to the view that everyone on the planet should forego a new washing machine, if your grandparents weren’t beaten and imprisoned for daring to object to the fact that no amount of toil would procure basic commodities. </p>



<p>There are three scraps of solace that we can take from this situation. Firstly, as has been shown by the way that people in the global south respond to catastrophic climate events, those with less often retain more resilient community networks — in contrast, high death tolls from heatwaves in Western Europe have been partly attributed to the fact that many elderly people live alone. Secondly, the unconventional history of Solidarność shows that class struggle does not have to follow a pre-ordained path. If working-class collective action can help topple one contradictory ideology, it can do so again. Finally, the way in which the region embraces the cultural significance of coal has a rich symbolic of power. Unlike the UK, they don’t simply want to forget all the dirt and blood bound up in the creation of energy systems &#8211; the focus of the next instalment documenting my journey. </p>

<p><br><em><strong>Nishma Doshi travelled around Europe with our </strong></em><a href="https://www.enough.scot/routes-response/"><em><strong>Routes programme</strong></em></a><em><strong>. Here they describe how fighting for housing rights is a part of climate justice in Barcelona.</strong></em></p>



<p><br>What is climate justice? What are we fighting for when we talk about stopping climate change?</p>



<p>Climate breakdown is a problem because it threatens our lives. It threatens our lives because it makes the world around us inhospitable, to us and to other species. It means losing our homes, access to clean water, access to good nutritious food, access to all our basic needs.</p>



<p>So when we are fighting for survival &#8211; which is what stopping climate change is about &#8211; we are fighting for our basic needs. We are fighting for healthy lives; we are fighting for the continued access to our basic needs. That&#8217;s ultimately what climate justice is about. It&#8217;s about an globally equal and equitable access to that which gives us life.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why one of my stops in Barcelona was at the <a href="http://labase.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">La Base: Ateneu Co-operatiu</a>, where the <a href="http://sindicatdebarri.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sindicat de barri del Poble Sec</a> (the neighbourhood union for the Poble Sec area) were having their weekly assembly. </p>



<p>Across Barcelona, different neighbourhoods (barris) have collectively organised to stop evictions and protect basic housing rights. Poble Sec is of particular interest as it is relatively small neighbourhood with a diverse population; residents come from across Europe, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador and Pakistan &#8211; as well as local Catalans.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The weekly meetings</h3>



<p>The sindicat meets once a week on Monday night. There, they discuss general strategies for upcoming political issues as well as provide support for community cases. Folks with cases &#8211; largely related to housing &#8211; drop their names in a jar at the beginning of the meeting, and after the strategy session ends, those names are pulled out, they get a chance to state their case, and assembly members collectively suggest support and solutions. </p>



<p>To be more inclusive, the meetings are held in Spanish (Castellano) as many of the migrants from Latin America do not speak Catalan. This is quite an important compromise made as many Catalans refuse to speak Castellano as a voice of dissent against the Spanish government which has repeatedly, and violently, repressed Catalonia&#8217;s demand for independence &#8211; as we are witnessing right now.</p>



<p>As I don&#8217;t speak Castellano or Catalan, I was kindly invited to the assembly by one of the sindicat&#8217;s members &#8211; Lorenzo. While the original aim of the sindicat was to deal with many political issues, he tells me, most of the actual organising work ends up being around housing as that is what is most urgent. Evictions are common due to rent rises, and increased property speculation. Most cases that come to the sindicat are related to evictions.</p>



<p>With Barcelona increasingly building its economy around tourism, property speculation in popular areas &#8211; like the city centre &#8211; is rampant. Airbnb** has also become a problem, with an increasing amount of flats and spare bedrooms used for temporary tourists rather than for local community housing. </p>



<p>There are also issues around rights to rent for those without the right papers &#8211; that can mean rights of residency to landlords requiring long-term job contracts. Many migrants feel caught in a trap: without rights of residency it is hard to find a job; and without a job it is impossible to rent a space in order to acquire rights of residency. This can be a problem for EU migrants too.</p>



<p>The meetings are organised in a circle (as far as possible) &#8211; with members volunteering for different roles each week. These roles can be &#8220;Masters of Ceremony&#8221; to childcare to welcoming new members. Fragments of the meeting which were translated to me were decisions on how to show solidarity with another barri eviction to how to respond to the sentences placed on Catalan leaders pushing for independence. It is observable how most of the strategy section engages more of the ethnic Catalan activists, while the racialised people* remain mostly quiet. <br><br>The case work is particularly interesting &#8211; and this is really where the issues of the immigrant population are raised. Once a name is called from the jar, that person either states their problem or gives an update on their case. Members of the community then give their advice and expertise. If needs be, the community will come together and stop an eviction or campaign together to challenge a landlord or the municipal government.</p>



<p>It is also important to note that, of the racialised people in attendence, almost all were women. I was told that women are often left with the responsibility of seeking help/support, especially in issues of housing and the family. This work is deeply gendered, with the majority of the responsibility falling on women.</p>



<p>Furthermore there is a visible divide between the racialised peoples in the space and the white activists &#8211; the latter seem to hold most of the organisational responsibility. One of them &#8211; Dan &#8211; also pointed out this distinction, calling it a unintentional &#8220;hierarchy&#8221;.</p>



<p>Obviously some work needs to be done to bridge these divides still. As I travelled and spoke to more people in Barcelona, this was an issue that was brought up over and over again. And it&#8217;s also been an issue I&#8217;ve observed in Scotland too. </p>



<p>In my experience, this often comes to how a space is run &#8211; the norms of the organisation can be &#8216;foreign&#8217; to those who have no direct experience of this kind of organising before.  And example of these norms could be consensus decision making or rotating roles. These norms are often uncritically accepted into organisational structures with no real space for reform or explorations of alternatives.</p>



<p>This makes it difficult for those of us who don&#8217;t fully embrace or feel part of anarchist organising to feel distanced or ostracised from the project. We are always working in ways which are culturally suited for our white colleagues and not really for us or the communities we come from. A longer discussion on community organising methods which centres the experiences of marginalised and racialised people seems really necessary if we want to overcome these divides.<br></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">La Base: Ateneu Co-operatiu</h3>



<p>La Base was formed after the Indignados movement, when people felt it was necessary to have infrastructure and access to amenities in order to organise for change.</p>



<p>The space has meeting rooms, a daily kitchen co-operative which serves up an affordable lunch, a workspace for basic building and repairs, a feminist collective, and a number of other projects apart from the sindicat. The projects provide local employment and benefits local companies and businesses.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Housing Justice is Climate Justice</h3>



<p>Hurricane Katrina destroyed the lives of so many people, houses were flooded and washed away. But the oak trees remained. They stood tall and weathered the storm because their roots were intertwinned. Of the over 700 oak trees in New Orleans, only 40 died. The rest held on.<br><br>As we saw with Katrina, responses to the catastrophic effects of climate change are deeply racialised. Black working class communities are still not getting the support they need.</p>



<p>As Clara-Luisa Weichelt and Julieta Perucca explain:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>&#8220;Governments worldwide fail to provide safe housing and basic infrastructure for a massive amount of people – and the challenges are increasing. People are frequently driven to live in informal settlements by environmental factors, such as natural disasters or environmental degradation that tend to happen more frequently due to climate change. But, the settlements to which they migrate also place them at risk: Nonresistant houses on land that is at risk of flooding, storm surges, mudslides, earthquakes, or contaminated sites, close to roads, waste and/or factories, is more likely to be vacant and is less likely to be contested for investment or development. The lack of basic infrastructure as access to drinking water, health provision, sewage systems, electricity and education as well as the lack of political and social recognition further exacerbates their vulnerability.&#8221;</p><cite><a href="https://www.habitants.org/news/global_info/the_nexus_between_the_right_to_housing_and_climate_change_insights_from_the_climate_conference_cop24_in_katowice_poland" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Nexus between the Right to Housing and Climate Change</a> – Insights from the Climate Conference COP24 in Katowice, Poland, (Thursday 10 January 2019)</cite></blockquote>



<p>Adequate housing rights for all, especially the marginalised in essential in preventing the worst impacts of climate change. Given the failure of governments to meet these basic needs, it has become essential that communities organise together to defend their rights.</p>



<p>If we want to survive what climate change is throwing at us now, as well as in the future, we need to find ways to supporting each other. The sindicat de barri del Poble Sec is one way which people are building connections and working together to deal with housing insecurity. While it&#8217;s not perfect, it&#8217;s providing many people with the support that they need; support that prevents them from ending up homeless and on the street.</p>



<p></p>



<p>*In Spain, People of Colour (PoC) or Black, Indigenous and People of Colour (BIPOC) are not used. The word commonly used translates as &#8220;racialised people&#8221;. This is because the process of Spain&#8217;s colonisation was dissimilar to that of British colonialism, and thus racial categories are different. <br>** While Spain has passed a law requiring all Airbnbs to pay taxes, EU data protection laws allow Airbnb to not disclose who is renting a room through the service. This means that the government struggles to enforce the tax. (This has been further impacted by a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/airbnb-wins-legal-victory-as-top-eu-court-defines-firm-as-information-society-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent EU court ruling</a> that has declared Airbnb not a real estate company)</p>
