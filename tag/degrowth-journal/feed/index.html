	<description>Enough! is an informal collective of activists in Scotland who have come together to take action on challenging our dominant economic system. We believe that inequality, oppression, injustice, power and ecological breakdown are all connected by the same story:</description>

<p><strong>LESS is a journal on degrowth, radical sufficiency and decolonisation in Scotland.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>LESS questions and challenges dominant narratives about what economic progress means in Scotland, and sketches out alternative visions. The focus is on collective and democratic solutions to sustaining livelihoods that meet people’s needs while rising to the threats of climate change, ecocide and mass extinction, inequality, racism and the far right, and the interconnected oppressive and extractivist logic and mechanisms that feed all of those.&nbsp;</p>



<p>LESS features a combination of thoroughly researched material, opinion pieces, poetry and art work, with contributions from those with lived knowledge in these areas, researchers, poets, creative writers and artists.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Issue 1 asks: What does degrowth mean in Scotland during the pandemic and for plans for an economic recovery?</strong></p>
