<h3 class="wp-block-heading">We are currently seeking contributions to our upcoming issue <strong>LESS #3</strong>:<strong> Degrowth and Decolonisation in the Red Zone</strong></h3>



<p>The recent<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> IPPC report</a> signals the latest three-alarm warning for humanity and the biosphere. It&#8217;s a red alert for the &#8216;red zone&#8217;- those areas of our planet responsible for the most emissions, which are also now squarely in the floodplain- including Scotland. </p>



<p>Beyond COP26, we invite contributions that focus on Scottish resistance to the climate crisis. The story emerging so far on the road to COP26 from mainstream commentators and media, party politics and corporate PR is that we can carry on industrial civilisation as per usual, by simply inserting a renewably-powered battery in the same old machine. This approach will almost certainly lead to collapse. Rather, we&#8217;re interested in clues and trails that lead away from this collision with planetary limits.  We seek responses that reflect grounded lived practice and fresh-thinking through degrowth and decolonisation to create a future-focused and outward looking climate justice movement. This needs innovation that responds to our times, as well as recovering traditional ecological and cultural knowledge, especially within a Scottish context, which can help restore fragments of meaning in our times of metacrisis. <br><br><strong>Submissions:</strong> We invite a combination of thoroughly researched material, opinion pieces, poetry and art work from those with lived knowledge in these areas, researchers, poets, creative writers and artists. If you&#8217;re interested in submitting a piece, please have a look at our <a href="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LESS.pdf">guidelines for contributors</a> and send us a short summary or abstract of your idea to less@enough.scot asap. We aim to have selected contributors by the end of August. The deadline for finished pieces is 4th October, and we pay a fee of £240.</p>



<p><strong>LESS is a journal on degrowth, radical sufficiency and decolonisation in Scotland.</strong> LESS questions and challenges dominant narratives about what economic progress means in Scotland, and sketches out alternative visions. The focus is on collective and democratic solutions to sustaining livelihoods that meet people’s needs while rising to the threats of climate change, ecocide and mass extinction, inequality, racism and the far right, and the interconnected oppressive and extractivist logic and mechanisms that feed all of those.<br><br><strong>Editorial team:</strong> Mike Small, Dr Mairi McFadyen, Dr Svenja Meyerricks and Luke Devlin</p>

<p><strong>Poem by Juana Adcock. Illustration: Fadzai Mwakutuya; photo: Ewan Bush</strong></p>



<p>This is from #2 of LESS &#8211; our journal of degrowth, radical sufficiency and decolonisation in Scotland. <a href="https://www.enough.scot/less/">Details of how to get a print copy here.</a></p>



<p></p>



<p><em><u>Steel</u></em></p>



<p>I place my palm en la reja called border wall.</p>



<p>Let its steel enter my body: iron alloyed with carbon</p>



<p>hardened to prevent the<em> movement of</em> <em>dislocations.</em></p>



<p>I am in Tijuana, looking at California through the bars</p>



<p>though it isn’t clear where the prison lies.</p>



<p>To my left the bars peter out into an ocean</p>



<p>whose waves refuse to be contained.</p>



<p>The body of an adult human</p>



<p>contains about four grams of iron;</p>



<p>all four of mine rush to meet la reja imantada.</p>



<p>When we speak of magnetism,</p>



<p>we think of love, or charisma,</p>



<p>or crowds of faces all in one direction.</p>



<p>But never of iron as the metal</p>



<p>at the active site of many enzymes</p>



<p>dealing with cellular respiration</p>



<p>or the pull towards a ‘better life’.</p>



<p>Glasgow’s sandstone tenements, incidentally,</p>



<p>are red because they contain iron.</p>



<p>Our blood stone is iron ore.</p>



<p>It emanates its own light.</p>



<p>We are the blood, migrating</p>



<p>bringing cargo</p>



<p>from one cell to the next</p>



<p>keeping the body alive, we transport</p>



<p>mercancía</p>



<p>maquinaria</p>



<p>manos</p>



<p>más.</p>



<p>The iron for the wall was mined in the M states</p>



<p>bordering with Canada.</p>



<p>Not that long ago, the land was cleared</p>



<p>of its people, wildlife and forests.</p>



<p>Migrants from Europe fed the logs down the rivers</p>



<p>laid the train tracks</p>



<p>peeled away life on the topsoil</p>



<p>bloodlet the earth to build</p>



<p>this line of steel</p>



<p>marking the limits of possession.</p>



<p>Praying from Carnegie’s <em>Gospel of Wealth</em></p>



<p>which built an empire of steel</p>



<p>repeating that this was progress</p>



<p>away from universal squalor</p>



<p>we were able to steal our eyes away</p>



<p>from the impoverishment</p>



<p>of the lands</p>



<p>—now empty red pits</p>



<p>gaping red wounds</p>



<p>as far as the eye can see.</p>



<p></p>



<p><em><u>The Letter M</u></em></p>



<p>With a guru’s moustache and a penchant for conspiracy</p>



<p>the madman explains to me that language is a form of mind control</p>



<p>the grammar itself holding us in a bind</p>



<p>– an incantation muttered over millenia</p>



<p>shaping our thoughts.</p>



<p>I want to master the art of the pictogram, he says.</p>



<p>It is the earliest form of writing</p>



<p>is uncontaminated by the misers, the drive for accumulation</p>



<p>created with the rise of agriculture.</p>



<p>The letter M, for example, is the pictogram of a wave</p>



<p>we forget where it comes from, it loses all meaning</p>



<p>we write it over and over without ever thinking of water</p>



<p>or how maritime and motherly,</p>



<p>muro y morada are of one essence.</p>



<p>As he speaks, I watch the surfers glide along the lip of the perfect breakers</p>



<p>almost for the whole line of the horizon</p>



<p>before they topple over into the sea</p>



<p>like tiny plastic soldiers.</p>



<p>That night we slept hearing the waves crash onto the rocks</p>



<p>and in the morning, we knew we were rocks too.</p>



<p>Our hearts, hardened lava.</p>



<p>The Pacific had smoothed round windows through us</p>



<p>and like a Barbara Hepworth sculpture</p>



<p>we were made whole</p>



<p>by what we lack.</p>



<p></p>



<p><em><u>Storylines</u></em></p>



<p>Roads are heavier on the rich side of the line.</p>



<p>Asphalt mixed with cement is whiter</p>



<p>loudening under car wheels, it hardens over time,</p>



<p>requiring little maintenance.</p>



<p>Such are the roads of the first world.</p>



<p>But the dwellings there are transient</p>



<p>wooden-framed and lighter</p>



<p>as if to be filled with</p>



<p>cushions and the crinkle of food wrappers</p>



<p>and some child’s quiet voice in a corner of the room</p>



<p>mouthing</p>



<p>and I’ll huff</p>



<p>and I’ll puff.</p>



<p>On the other side of the line</p>



<p>the asphalt grows crocodile-skinned.</p>



<p>Pockmarked and permeable,</p>



<p>it can cope with earthquakes</p>



<p>and melt in the sun.</p>



<p>Initially it’s cheaper to lay</p>



<p>but has a shorter lifespan.</p>



<p>Such the roads of the third world.</p>



<p>But here, our houses</p>



<p>you can tell by just looking at them</p>



<p>are made of cement, heavy as pyramids</p>



<p>as if to hold us at home</p>



<p>for longer.</p>



<p></p>
