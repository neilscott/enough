										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Enough! has joined with another 115 charities, economists, businesses, trade unions and academics to send an open letter to Scotland’s First Minister calling for an “urgent transition to a Wellbeing Economy.” Read the statement here: &#8216;<a href="https://www.weallscotland.org/_files/ugd/d7012c_5be16a45f7c9463cbdbae2717202c7a6.pdf?index=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redesigning our Economy for People and Planet: Joint Statement on the Wellbeing Economy (weallscotland.org)</a>&#8216; and the text of the letter below.</strong><br><br><strong>The Enough! Collective believes in the principles and values of a wellbeing economy and supports efforts of civil society to exercise pressure on our government. And we also believe that deeper change won&#8217;t, in fact can&#8217;t happen when we are still wedded to an economic system based on perpetual growth and rampant exploitation.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Redesigning our economy is essential as considerable suffering and loss, resulting from our current economic model, are already being keenly experienced across the globe. For Enough!, well-being for all is only possible if we break with growth.</strong><br><br>Dear First Minister<br><br>We are writing to you as a group of social and environmental justice NGOs, grassroots community groups, faith groups, service providers, funders, economists, academics, think tanks and business leaders united in our belief that Scotland must urgently transition to a Wellbeing Economy.<br><br>Many of us are firefighting to provide frontline support to those swept up in the rising tide of destitution.<br><br>Others among us are trying to play our part in the transition to an economy that values people and the environment, for example, piloting new ways of providing for each other, running community energy projects and deploying alternative business models that contribute to our communities.  Others are directly involved in efforts to restore nature and tackle poverty.<br><br>Too many people in Scotland are living in cold homes, skipping meals and falling behind on rent while Scotland&#8217;s 20 richest families own more wealth than 30 percent of the poorest citizens combined. In the most deprived 30% of Scottish areas life expectancy is falling. At the same time, there are growing fears that Scotland’s legal emissions reductions targets will be missed and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recently warned that the world faces a &#8220;brief and rapidly closing window to secure a liveable future.&#8221; The IPCC also echoed our collective belief that GDP is a poor metric of human<br>wellbeing.<br><br>As a founding member of the Wellbeing Economy Governments partnership, Scotland has played an important role in building momentum for change among governments. We were pleased to see the aspiration to become a Wellbeing Economy contained within Scotland&#8217;s National Strategy for Economic Transformation. We also welcomed the publication of the first iteration of the Wellbeing Economy monitor, efforts to encourage fair work, support for community wealth building and the commitment to review how to increase the number of purposeful and democratic businesses in Scotland. And we are looking forward to seeing the recommendations of the Business Purpose Commission and Just Transition Commission being taken forward. These are steps in the right direction.<br><br>But we are writing to you today because we are concerned that progress isn’t happening fast enough to meet the very real and urgent challenges we face. To date, we have not seen substantive progress in redesigning our economy which continues to break planetary limits and create high levels of inequality.<br><br>With its narrow focus on GDP growth, the National Strategy for Economic Transformation is grounded in the same logic that has delivered decades of poverty, inequality and environmental degradation. What is required now is a robust plan to put the wellbeing of people and nature at the heart of our economy.<br><br>Today we have published a joint statement on what we envision such a Wellbeing Economy to look like in Scotland, which will require actions from governments in both Westminster and Holyrood.<br><br>As next steps on the journey to a Wellbeing Economy we ask you and the Scottish Government to use the powers at your disposal to:<br><strong>Transform the National Performance Framework into a Wellbeing Framework and strengthen its power and reach.</strong><br><br>● In the short-term, this requires a comprehensive engagement process to underpin the review of the National Outcomes so the people of Scotland have a voice in shaping what the framework measures.<br><br>● In the medium term, ensure the upcoming Wellbeing and Sustainable Development Bill puts the wellbeing framework on a stronger statutory footing to provide a clear vision for public bodies, bringing together and strengthening a range of duties to put collective wellbeing and environmental sustainability at the centre of decision-making. This should include enhanced support and scrutiny mechanisms, for example through the promised Future Generations’ Commissioner. The Scottish Government should also bring forward a clear outcome budgeting framework, evidencing how public spending delivers wellbeing outcomes.<br><br><strong>Use devolved tax powers to share Scotland’s wealth more evenly and support public investment in a strong social safety net, universal basic services, fair public sector wages and environmental improvements needed for a Wellbeing Economy.</strong><br><br>● In the short-term, the next Budget should continue progressive moves to increase tax revenue more fairly and clearly set out both the distributional impacts of this and how revenue will be invested in areas that can help Scotland progress to a Wellbeing Economy.<br><br>● In the medium term, the Scottish Government should undertake wide-ranging public<br>engagement to develop options to realise a fully progressive tax system, including more<br>fundamental reforms to income tax rates and bands, a clear roadmap for reforming /replacing the regressive council tax, and options to utilise local tax powers.<br><br><strong>Reshape the business environment in Scotland to facilitate a shift towards purposeful and democratic business practices that support collective wellbeing and environmental sustainability and do not profit from undermining either of them.</strong><br><br>● In the short-term, enterprise agencies and all public business support should prioritise<br>purposeful and democratic business practices, including social enterprises, cooperatives and employee-owned enterprises, as recommended by the Business Purpose Commission. All projects to support entrepreneurship, innovation and start-ups delivered as a part of the<br>National Strategy for Economic transformation should be focused on those businesses that can make the biggest contribution to a Wellbeing Economy and should be tailored to different rural and urban contexts.<br><br>● In the medium-term, fair work conditions on public sector grants and contracts should be<br>strengthened and extended to other dimensions of a Wellbeing Economy, including<br>environmental aspects and democratic governance structures. Options should be developed for better incentivising purposeful business – for example, reforms to non-domestic rates and the introduction of environmental levies.<br><br>Scotland is full of hopeful and inspirational action that is putting the Wellbeing Economy thinking into practice. But transforming such actions into the economy we all need will require bolder action by the Scottish Government to set the direction of the economy, it requires a stronger infrastructure for participation in economic policy-making, ensuring that seldom heard voices are listened to, and it requires increased public investment into places, people and nature to deliver what really matters to people.<br><br>We hope that you will consider our asks and we would be keen to meet to discuss this further.<br><br>Signed by<br>Ailsa Raeburn, Chair, Community Land Scotland<br>Alan McClouskey, Chief Executive, Voluntary Sector Gateway West Lothian<br>Alfie Stirling, Chief Economist, New Economics Foundation<br>Amanda Burgauer, Executive Director, Common Weal<br>Professor Andrew Cumbers, Professor of Political Economy, Adam Smith Business School, University of<br>Glasgow<br>Professor Andrew Watterson, Emeritus Professor of Health, Stirling University<br>Angus Hardie, Director, Scottish Community Alliance<br>Annette Hastings, Professor of Urban Studies, University of Glasgow<br>B.D.

<p><strong>An online collaborative learning programme with a residential learning retreat / field trip to Ullapool, run in partnership by the <a href="http://www.che.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Centre for Human Ecology</a> and Enough! Scotland.<br><br>The programme consists of&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>A weekly online session: <strong>Wednesdays 6.30pm &#8211; 8.30pm, <strong>Sept 14th &#8211; Nov 16th 2022</strong></strong></strong></li>



<li><strong>A residential learning retreat and field trip in the Ceilidh Place, Ullapool Oct 10th-14th.</strong></li>



<li><strong>Self-directed study: through a course handbook, online resources and a practice-based inquiry / study / creative exploration.&nbsp;</strong></li>



<li><strong>3 additional peer group meetings will be held over the period of the course (times to be agreed by each group)</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><strong><br>Description: </strong>An invitation to social and environmental practitioners, community workers and activists working in Scotland to collaboratively explore how the principles of degrowth and radical human ecology can inform and catalyse change. A 10-week programme, delivered as a partnership between Enough! Scotland and the Centre for Human Ecology, including a 4 night residential learning retreat and field trip at the Ceilidh Place in Ullapool in the Scottish Highlands.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>In times marked by an accelerating climate crisis, we explore together what degrowth could look like in Scotland, through a framing of human ecology and systems thinking. We understand ‘degrowth’ as meaning intergenerational social, ecological and migrant justice through decolonisation and equity within planetary limits – and this includes growth of socially and ecologically beneficial activity. The aim of this course is to create ripples to embed principles and practices of degrowth and human ecology among community and climate activists across Scotland. The course consists of a weekly online session with a talk followed by discussion, as well as readings for self-directed study. A key component of the course is to co-create a community of practice and peer-learning , which will be supported through a series of online peer group meetings and an in-depth 3.5-day (4 nights) residential in Ullapool. We draw upon methods taken from popular education and anti-oppression practices, peer-coaching and practical and immersive exercises.</p>



<p>The course takes place in the 50th anniversary year of the founding of the Centre for Human Ecology and the publication of Limits to Growth. We look forward to forming a learning community with you.</p>



<p><strong>Course format:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>8 online sessions:</strong> Each session will consist of a presentation on key themes in degrowth and human ecology, followed by a facilitated group discussion and break-out groups to digest the material.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Peer group meetings:</strong> There will be three additional online peer group meetings at times to be agreed by each group, and time dedicated to peer groups at the residential, in person.</p>



<p><strong>Contributors: </strong>Bronagh Gallagher, <a href="https://degrowth.org/lorenzo-velotti/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lorenzo Velotti</a>, Luke Devlin, <a href="http://www.mairimcfadyen.scot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr Mairi McFadyen</a>, <a href="https://www.rolandplayle.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roland Playle</a> and <a href="https://www.che.ac.uk/people/svenja-meyerricks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr Svenja Meyerricks</a>, with others to be announced</p>



<p><strong>Who is the course for? </strong>A key aim of the course is to develop the knowledge and capability of degrowth and human ecology principles among community and climate activists in Scotland. Participants are encouraged to either be normally resident in Scotland, or have another significant connection or interest.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Costs:</strong> Course fees are set on a sliding-scale, meaning you can choose the fee you are able to pay and we trust that this is the right amount for you. If you are in a position to pay the base cost rate or more either from your own income or from organisational training budgets, it will enable us to offer the course to others in the future. <strong>We also do not want finances to be a barrier to accessing the course and you are invited to pay what you are able to.</strong> Recommended scale*:</p>

<p><strong>LESS is a journal on degrowth, radical sufficiency and decolonisation in Scotland.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Issue 4: the ecology issue.</p>



<p>With Glasgow&#8217;s COP26 fading into history as another milestone in industrial civilisations&#8217; failure to reckon seriously with the root causes of climate change, the limitations of our ability to handle diffuse, complex risk becomes clearer. Our national and global institutions, predicated on an anthropocentric worldview and quasi-fanatical adherence to the goal of economic growth is undermining the basis for life as we know it, and not just for humans.</p>



<p>Degrowth and its sister term decolonisation argue that the economy as presently constructed inevitably unleashes destruction of the natural world. This is the inevitable outcome of infinite growth in a finite material world. As we’ve said “Climate crisis is manifest destiny.”</p>



<p><strong>In this issue, we explore attacks on ecosystems, biodiversity loss, habitat destruction, resource depletion and scarcity in Scotland and beyond. How do our actions and consumption impact beyond our shores? What are the critical losses we have faced and will face right here?</strong></p>



<p>How has perpetual growth and consumption undermined eroded and destroyed: land and soil; air quality in our cities; water purity in our seas and lochs and rivers; and driven some species to extinction?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But as well as looking critically and honestly at the reality of ecological disaster in Scotland we will also look at restorative practices, regenerative practical projects and movements and examples of fresh thinking which addresses the realities we are facing. Forms of traditional ecological knowledge, biomimetics, practices and lifeways that de-centre human supremacy may give us clues to live well within limits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For this issue, we seek contributions on these and related themes. We are interested in non-fiction, reportage, field reports and case studies, poetry, illustrations and photography.</p>



<p>See our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LESS-guidelines1.pdf">guidelines for contributors</a>&nbsp;for details including fees.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Deadline for submissions: 18th April 2022</p>

<p><em>Affordable access to secure, decent housing was difficult enough for many before the pandemic. Afterwards, it’s even worse. Buyers fleeing urban environments for an ‘improved quality of life’ have created a particularly overheated property market in the Highlands and Islands. Rural areas already suffering from depopulation and chronic housing shortages for locals, especially young people, are at risk of becoming even more stratified. An underground network of rebel DIY housebuilders and campaigners are fighting back, finding ways to move through the cracks of a broken system to build the foundations for housing and land for all. LESS spoke to one of them, musician and strawbale self-build advocate Craig Bryce (Brycey) about life and work on the offgrid home he shares with his family at Cannich, in a woodland clearing overlooking Glen Affric. Brycey also shares his poetical reflections on COP26. The interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.</em> Illustrations by Owen McLaughlin.</p>

<p><strong>Luke Devlin (LD): How did you get from being involved in the punk scene, underground DIY music and anarchism in Glasgow to deciding you wanted to live in the Highlands? What did you learn from DIY underground culture that helped you in that journey</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> and what lessons can you take from that kind of non-hierarchical organising in order to find these opportunities within this really dominating environment?</strong></p>



<p>Brycey (B): We became exposed to the European squat scene and the idea that you can just set up whatever you need for yourself. It obviously needed you to have a physical space for that, and that just didn’t seem possible in a flat in Glasgow. Sitting in Glasgow in our early-20s we were going, ‘Right, in order to actually make that happen you have to live on the land and with the land.’ So myself and Angus [Quinn, vocalist of Brycey’s hardcore punk band, Sedition] moved to the Highlands way back then, and had a wee go at it. I ended up at the intentional community of Talamh. That was the thing that felt for me that we’ve got a physical space, we’ve got a foothold, and we’ve got collectivisation which allows us to have a way together bigger than our own individual resources.</p>



<p>I then realised that people with no assets, if they collectivised could buy an 18th century farmhouse and 16 acres of land. We made that happen, and then we realised that we could also tap into different things by getting funding, by being in different organisations and learning in so many different ways. So we could identify a skills gap at Talamh and then try and find some way of getting someone trained to do it.</p>



<p>That just felt like an extension of the DIY underground squat thing where you would just take a building and you would just look after yourself. The one that really sticks out was The Wohlgroth in Switzerland; it had everything from a women’s refuge to a clothes shop to a metal workshop, a wood workshop, a microbrewery.&nbsp;It had everything, right in the centre of Zürich, it was unbelievable. Completely blew me away that you could just get a bunch of people organising like that. So Talamh was a bit like a university for me in terms of giving me the idea that you can do that outwith the squat scene and within the landownership situation that happens within the UK. You can kind of circumvent it, through the power of collectivism.</p>



<p>I went down the career route of getting into doing outdoor education. Both my partner and I worked for a charity called Venture Trust out in Applecross, so we were living and working there, basically helping young offenders figure out how to get out of the court system and sort their lives out by taking them out on ten day expeditions and creating your own wee tribe, creating new value systems and helping people look at their lives differently. That helped us because we didn&#8217;t need to have a house, because there was tied housing or a caravan that you could stay in, so we were able to just save all our money. That meant we could start looking for land somewhere.</p>



<p>We didn&#8217;t want to end up with loads of debt or a mortgage, so that meant we needed to do it ourselves as much as possible and with the help of other people. So far, the whole build’s been done, apart from digging out the foundations, by myself and [my partner] Ele or friends and family and volunteers. We did get a company called Straw Works to come in, pioneers in straw bale housebuilding in the UK. They put the car tyre foundations in, the straw-bale walls, all the key skill bits like that, and ran those as courses with volunteers who wanted to learn that.</p>



<p>For the other bits, we’ve just watched Youtube videos! And asked for help from other people, and you really quickly tap into another community up here because it’s normal for folk to build their own houses, it’s not an unusual thing. You talk to the woman in the shop and she says, ‘Aye, I’ve built two,’ and it’s not a big deal at all, it’s dead normal. You meet someone and they’ll say, ‘Yeah, I grew up in a caravan until I was eight because my parents were building our house,’ and all that. It&#8217;s just a thing that happens here. And when at key points you need something, like you’ve got to do an Amish barn-raising or something, 15 people will turn up who have all built their own houses and understand what it feels like to be in that position and they’ll come and help you do that. You might be from very different walks of life and have different ideas politically, but it’s like, ‘No, we know about that, we’re going to come help you do that bit of your house.’</p>



<p>With our neighbours, we’re co-operating on getting the water and services set up, and we’ve made the decision to stay off-grid. We’ll probably end up with a micro-hydro and a mixture of wind and solar for the site.</p>



<p>We’ve lived off-grid basically for eight years here. So we were feeling smug when there was a power cut down in the village! We were at my dad’s the other night and all the lights went out and my wee boy Oran’s like, ‘What’s that?’ ‘It’s a power cut, son.’ ‘What’s a power cut?’ He couldn’t even understand the concept ‘cause we’re harvesting our own energy where we are.</p>

<p><strong>LD: In terms of the build and the skills and resources that were needed, what was your starting point in terms of construction knowledge?</strong></p>



<p>B: Yeah we knew absolutely fuck all about any of it man! Ele’s quite a voracious reader, she’ll research anything she wants to get into, so she did a whole design that was like a frame with straw bale infill. And then there was a course out in Elgin that the Straw Works people ran and [Ele] became really inspired. It’s a load-bearing straw&nbsp;bale build, so the walls are actually held up by the bales, so there’s quite minimal carpentry in it and it’s quite basic. So it feels quite accessible and achievable.</p>



<p>There’s been lots of bits of it so far where we’ve been like, ‘What are we doing?!’ But again, we’ve got a friend who’s been a really good help to us and has done more traditional buildings before and was like, ‘I’ll come help you put your roof truss in’, and it’s just been like, ‘Oh yeah, that guy knows that, I’ve got a mate that knows this,’ and then just researching it.</p>



<p>If you were a roofer you’d look at our roof and go, ‘Aye that’s a bit shonky,’ and if you were a carpenter you’d look at our verandas and go, ‘Urgh.’ But we’re not bothered about that because it’s felt really empowering to do it ourselves, it’s felt like quite a primal thing to create our own home. I think the only way we’ve been able to access stuff like that’s maybe been through things like up at Carbeth to build a hut up there, and there’s a community to help you. Whereas when you get into this kind of sustainable self-build, it just feels right – part of what we should be doing as a human being.</p>



<p>We’re on year three of it, but that’s because we’re trying to do it without a mortgage, so we’re not employing any tradespeople to come in because a) we can’t afford to, and b) we don’t really want to until we really need to. If it’s got to be signed off, like electrics, then we’ll have to do that, but we’re trying to do everything ourselves, and for that to be part of the whole thing. Which means it takes a lot longer, and it’s a bit frustrating.</p>



<p>But we’ve already helped other people, we’ve met other straw-bale folk that have started on that journey and we’ve been able to go and mentor them a wee bit and give them what they need – there’s a kind of reciprocity to it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="773" height="526" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screenshot-from-2021-11-19-16-09-111.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9645" srcset="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screenshot-from-2021-11-19-16-09-111.png 773w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screenshot-from-2021-11-19-16-09-111-300x204.png 300w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screenshot-from-2021-11-19-16-09-111-768x523.png 768w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screenshot-from-2021-11-19-16-09-111-585x398.png 585w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screenshot-from-2021-11-19-16-09-111-100x68.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 773px) 100vw, 773px" /></figure>



<p><strong>L</strong><strong>D</strong><strong>: </strong><strong>What more support should there be for people that are wanting to do that?</strong></p>



<p>B: There are a lot of people just doing it! And obviously they don’t want to publicise it. There are people all over the Highlands that are like, ‘Right, I’m putting something in there and I’ll wait to see if they find me.’ And there are ways of doing it where you might be like, ‘Right, my build is like a forester’s hut where I stay when I’m working in the woods,’ and then eventually it gets a change of use on it. All these things are underground and DIY, and I think the Thousand Huts campaign from Reforesting Scotland is feeding into that, there’s a lot of skills going round that, even though the flipside of that is there’s a lot of people with loads of money that are turning it into a strictly middle class or upper class pursuit almost.</p>



<p>Some folk do manage to blog it and use it as training opportunities and things like that. I don’t have space to do that, I’m barely able to be involved in anything else other than building the house, looking after my family, and doing the work I need to do.</p>



<p>It needs to be broken down for people to really repopulate and be here and live and work on the land in a way that’s beneficial and supports a lot of folk and reverses the rural depopulation trend. The Airbnb thing’s only made it worse. Young folk just cannae get a hoose. It’s not new to the Highlands, but it’s intensifying more and more. You add COVID into that and everyone leaving the cities to come to their ‘rural idyll’; and the carbon credits, Brewdog creating a fucking forest to pretend they’re carbon neutral. There’s a lot of pressure that makes landownership even more tricky to get to.</p>



<p><strong>LD: There is a challenging element to the commitment you’ve made that tests you to a certain extent, and forces you to maybe become more resilient and increase your capability in terms of exposure to taking care of your fundamental ne</strong><strong>eds in a way that isn’t about just buying a product or buying a service, because you have to do it yourself. What have been the main lessons you have learned about what really matters in life, and what are the most important things about human flourishing?</strong></p>



<p>B: The things that on the surface other folk would be like, ‘Woah, are you mad?,’ like having to go and smash the pond with a sledgehammer to get water out of it because everything is frozen solid in the middle of the winter or whatever. We could have better systems in place that would mean we wouldn’t have to do that, that’s the thing, problem solving. You can’t buy a product to do that because you’re like, ‘Right, so we need to get water from a pond all the way up the hill to come down to our caravan somehow.’ So you’ve got to problem-solve everything that way. And that, again, feels really empowering. Then when you’ve got your roasting hot, pummeling 12 volt shower and you’re like, ‘Yes, we did it!’ Now it’s broken, so I’m not boasting that much! But all those systems that we had to figure out at first, it’s just a total learning journey that makes you feel a sense of self-worth that wouldn’t happen if you were just buying a product to solve those problems.</p>



<p>We’re really lucky&nbsp;– the elements here, when it’s windy, you know it’s windy; when it’s cold, you know it’s cold. When we actually get the build finished and move in, we’re moving ourselves slightly away from that to a different level of comfort that’s going to feel really strange because we’ve lived like this for eight years now. And when it gets to the deep winter this year and it’s -10°C again, and the whole site you can’t drive a vehicle onto for maybe four months, and there’s ice on the inside of the bedroom windows, there’s points where you’re like, ‘Urgh.’ But there’s points where you do need to just dig a little deeper. And just that kind of slight life-threatening adversity brings something else out of you as a human being. And we do use technology. We watch films, we’re chatting on Zoom now, we sit and play music, we do other things&nbsp;– it’s not as if we’re sitting here carving spoons all night with a candle on. But it is different from living in a city with technology surrounding you as a thing that you just turn to all the time.</p>



<p>You just naturally spend more time in awe of nature. You’ve got to get your wood to bring down for the burner and you’re looking at the view, or you see a red kite flying above you. You just feel a connection that you don’t get unless you’re living a bit closer to the land like this. And I think that moves also to having a spiritual connection, a feeling much more of belonging to where you are. I’ve bought a bit of land but I don’t really believe in landownership, but I did it because I didn’t want anyone to be able to take the housing that I have away from me and I wanted to be empowered by that. Also observing the Celtic calendar and all that –&nbsp;you’re in that tradition, you’re playing that music, you’re hearing that language, you’re hearing the wind and the rain and it’s all part of what enriches your life. We feel really lucky. Especially when COVID happened, we couldn’t be in a better place. We grow as much of our food as we can, we use an organic veg box, and I get most of the rest of my food from Highland Wholefoods. We rarely deal with supermarkets, we’ve removed ourselves a little bit from that.</p>



<p>Even the house; all the windows were bought second hand, as much as we can. We felled and milled all the wood on site here ourselves. Instead of going and buying the timber, you actually get your mates and chop the trees down and mill them yourself, and you just do that with everything. It’s just part of how you try and operate. And it saves you a lot of money now as well, because the prices are insane. We’ve got our wood out there for the rest of the build, and if we had to buy that now, we’d not be able to.</p>



<p>I do feel more centred as a human being – with my family on the land, doing what I’m doing – than I ever have in my life. And there’s lots of reasons for that, but I think it is that thing of thinking, ‘Right, I’m putting my roots down here and this is a long term thing.’ And it’s not, ‘Oh, then we can sell the house and move somewhere else and move up the ladder,’ and all that. This is for Oran, when I’m away this is Oran’s house, and hopefully his family’s place if that’s what he wants. Once we’ve moved on from the house being built, we’ll try and get a self-sustaining ecosystem here which is also inclusive for people to come and enjoy. I wouldn’t rule out us trying to get involved in helping people access this kind of thing in a more formal way once we have finished everything, because it’s important to me to not just be like, ‘We’re sorted now,’ and then sit back.</p>

<p><strong>L</strong><strong>D</strong><strong>: </strong><strong>What are your thoughts on sharing that learning about relationship and reciprocity that you mentioned with </strong><strong>folk that are living in cities who either are not going to have the opportunity to do it or maybe don’t want to? Many want to live in a city, or have to, but how people live in cities has to change drastically as well.</strong></p>



<p>B: It’s as simple as collective organisation&nbsp;–&nbsp;something like GAS [Glasgow Autonomous Space] being there now, or even the Kinning Park Complex and the way that operates.&nbsp;There’s lots of small scale things like that already happening, and they are all actually there, it’s just that you don’t hear about it. I think it will scale up, I don’t think it’s going to drop away suddenly. Going back to COP26 and the bigger picture of it, like Greta Thunberg is saying, the way capitalists are going to ‘fix’ climate change, capitalism and climate change are interlinked – the thing we keep coming up against is land and property ownership. I don’t mean just demonstrations, but just linking up as communities and creating these autonomous spaces as well, and then networks will just keep growing. Because people are realising that the people in power are not doing it and are not going to do it. Mutual aid basically, anarchism. Who are the people stepping up and getting things done at the refugee camps? It’s not the authorities. It’s mutual aid. It’s that spirit that underpins everything.</p>



<p>It needs more direct action activism, but what Talamh and the Pollok Free State really taught me is that you can’t spend all your energy going against what you don’t like as it leaves very little to create what you do like. I think that’s tipped over a bit now and loads of people are building what they do like, and seeing those networks, just small groups and collectives of people who are working together – that’s the only way I can kind of see this knowledge spreading out without getting greenwashed or co-opted.</p>



<p>I do worry that it’s too slow –&nbsp;because the power of what it’s up against in terms of resurgent fascism and climate change, and the way that the powers that be seem to be able to just manipulate the media narrative. My only way of staying sane against that is to actually just link up with people and go and do what you want to happen.</p>



<p>And whether that’s being at COP and having the demonstrations and all the rest of it, or creating a food garden in your local area and teaching people how to grow in an urban setting. And making sure places don’t get gentrified and developed, there’s green space, cycle routes, all these little victories. You can’t expect these powers that be to change because they rely so heavily on the profit motive, they don’t seem to understand that GDP shouldn’t be all we focus on. It’s starting to happen, but it needs to happen now.</p>



<p>Our society is fragile and vulnerable because we’ve been deskilled so much in that way, we just phone someone these days, you don’t do it yourself. Things like tool libraries and being able to actually share that expertise is key. I’m not being totally prepper about it, but industrial society is not going to be able to keep going the way it is, so you need a different set of skills to transition through that. And that includes the ability to be able to organise co-operatively and interact with each other that doesn’t involve hierarchies and coercion. And that’s such a valuable skill that we’re really going to need.</p>



<p>As a movement to become something bigger and stronger, it has to involve the people in the schemes as well. I remember there was a group called the Milton Class War Casuals and they were mad techno heads, but they looked like a bunch of mad neds that just went out clubbing, but they were switched on politically. If you had all the schemes like that, the power that is sitting in those communities if they were plugged into all these things as well. Resistance to capitalism and what’s happening with climate is pretty white and middle class and that’s something that really needs to change.</p>

<p>There is a great quote by Bill Shankly (the famous Scottish manager of Liverpool FC) who said, “Football isn’t a matter of life or death. It’s more important than that.” I feel much the same about education.</p>



<p>The Scottish Government is currently undertaking a consultation on Education Reform until 26<sup>th</sup> November 2021. (1) The stimulus for this is another report from the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) titled ‘Scotland’s Curriculum For Excellence – Into the Future’. Other than appreciating the report’s authors’ bone dry sense of humour, there is nothing ‘Into the Future’ (2)about the report at all. A more appropriate title might have been ‘Scotland’s Curriculum for Excellence – More of the Past’. If you were motivated to let your eyes wander through some of the 141 pages of the report, you could be forgiven for forgetting – as the authors seem to have done – that a climate emergency even exists.</p>



<p>This OECD Report follows their 2015 policy review ‘Improving Schools in Scotland an OECD Perspective’ (3) which has had a major impact on Scottish education policy. The First Minister pledged their political integrity on achieving the closing of the attainment gap between the best and least well performing pupils in Scotland’s comprehensive schools. Since 2015, around £120 million of public funding has been duly allocated via mechanisms such as the Pupil Equity Fund and the Attainment Scotland Fund. There may be some readers who find this policy approach somewhat problematic; I would agree. Without having to go into enormous detail, let us just start with a few salient facts (not alternative facts I hasten to add – you remember what facts are, I presume, articles of information which relate to truth).</p>



<p>Firstly, children in Scotland, if they attend school regularly, only spend roughly 15% of their lives in school. Secondly, as James McEnaney helpfully points out in his new book <em>Class Rules: The Truth about Scottish Schools</em>, quoting Professor Dylan Wiliam of University College London’s Institute of Education, “only 7% of the variation between schools on this standard benchmark is due to the effect of the school. The other 93% is due to factors over which the school has no control.” It seems there is a distinct possibility that children learn things when they are not at school! If only we had data to prove it! Thirdly, and I will stop here because this list could go on for some time, neither the OECD reports nor the Scottish Government scrutiny of the Curriculum for Excellence apply to – wait for it – Private Schools. Is this because private schooling has no impact on educational inequality in Scotland? This seems unlikely. McEnaney captures the impact of private schooling quite eloquently in these lines:</p>



<p><strong>“These elitist organisations are undeniable engines of social inequality – that is after all, the whole point of their existence. They sell social segregation rather than superior education, charging thousands and thousands of pounds per year for their product. Private schools allow the wealthy to purchase even greater privileges, and even deeper connections, for their kids and further distort our society in the process. It’s simple: public education exists to mitigate inequality whilst private education exists to protect it.”</strong> (4)</p>



<p>Yet, I would argue, there are much bigger issues at stake in the political and culture wars that surround state education policy than performance tables and standardised testing. The fact that so much time, effort, and financial resources are still being poured into research and policy that takes little to no account of our ongoing crises of climate, biodiversity, inequality, and perpetual war should be of deep concern, not only to those who would see themselves as educators, but to all those desiring a better and liveable future for human and more-than-human life on earth.</p>



<p>Given education’s key role in social reproduction, the fact that education policy in Scotland is still left to the ‘experts’ at the OECD is a travesty. It is long past time that education – lifelong rather than 3-18, the age groups covered by the CfE – becomes a more central ‘ground of contestation’ regarding anti-capitalism, decolonisation, gender equality, and ecological justice. A group of young activists called <a href="https://www.teachthefuture.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teach the Future</a> (5) are demanding fundamental change to educational practice around environmental issues. They also recognise that issues of climate change cannot be extracted from issues of climate justice, racial equality, and the broader vision of human and environmental rights. While the Scottish Government and Scottish Education make great emphasis on the value of ‘pupil voice’, whether young people are ultimately listened to still largely relies on whether or not their views threaten the current status quo.</p>



<p>There are many groups seeking to change approaches to education in Scotland. <a href="https://www.upstart.scot/reasons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UPSTART</a> is one such group that wishes to see Scotland bring in a Kindergarten stage before primary, with ‘school’ start age raised to 7 years old. Their website offers an interesting perspective on why formal schooling in the UK starts at between 4 and 5 years of age:</p>



<p><strong>“We’re trapped by history and tradition. In 1870, the English parliament chose an early school starting age so children’s mothers could provide cheap labour in factories. Scotland followed suit, and ever since we’ve taken it for granted that formal education must start at five. (Only 12% of countries worldwide start children at school so early – and all bar one are ex-members of the British Empire.)”</strong>(6)</p>



<p>But don’t get your hopes up: despite a significant research base to support such a move, raising the age of formal schooling and bringing in a Kindergarten system is not on the agenda. The focus seems to remain on rearranging the deck chairs rather than setting a new course.</p>



<p>I would argue that the entire data gathering, and analytical processes employed by the OECD are highly dubious and lead to policy and practice being driven by data analysis and research that is unconsciously and in some cases consciously biased. Why do we feel that it makes sense or is desirable to measure the ‘performance’ of pupils in Scotland’s schools as against those in China, Russia, or Qatar for example? However, if we wish to put store in the learning power of ‘PISA’ (the OECD&#8217;s Programme for International Student Assessment) then it tells us some fairly worrying tales, such as:</p>



<p><strong>“Students in Scotland report slightly lower life satisfaction than the OECD average and more prevalent fear of failure than average.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Competition between students seems to be slightly more common in Scotland than co-operation. In 2018, some 73% of students reported that it seemed ‘very’ or ‘extremely true’ to them that students were competing against each other, whereas only 61% said they observed co-operation among students.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Students report more often being exposed to bullying in Scotland than on average across OECD countries and economies (index of 0.23 for a basis 0 on average). A larger share of students are bullied frequently (11.4% compared to 7.8%).”</strong>(7)</p>



<p>The issues of life satisfaction, feeling of competition versus co-operation, and the incidence and impact of bullying point to one of the realities that is all-too-often obscured or missed entirely by much research and discussion relating to education: Our schools are reflections of our society and they are evermore platforms for social welfare rather than education. In Austerity Scotland 2021, schools feed children not just ideas but calories and take on a huge amount of work that previously would have been seen to fall to social work, youth work, and other health support services. Due to the ongoing cull of public services, schools are increasingly seen as the panacea for the delivery of the social justice agenda. They are given an impossible task and criticised when they fail to achieve it.</p>



<p>I would argue the points raised thus far already make the case for a wholesale re-evaluation of the current processes and practices of education in Scotland, but let me close this article with what I believe is the most compelling reason of all.</p>



<p><strong>Education policy in a climate emergency</strong></p>



<p>Greta Thunberg, among others, has been doing an excellent job of pointing out that in many ways one of the greatest dangers facing the world now is not just the continued inaction of governments to address climate emergency and wider inequality and suffering, it is the ‘pretence’ that steps are being taken which are in any sense adequate to address the scale of the crisis. “Build back better. Blah, blah, blah. Green economy. Blah blah blah. Net zero by 2050. Blah, blah, blah,” she said in a speech to the Youth4Climate summit in Milan, Italy, this year. “This is all we hear from our so-called leaders. Words that sound great but so far have not led to action. Our hopes and ambitions drown in their empty promises.” (8)</p>



<p>I see echoes of this active inaction in Scottish education’s dalliance with what is termed Learning for Sustainability (LfS). LfS plays host to a mind-boggling array of fascinating subjects as this word cloud attests:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="768" height="606" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/768-606-max.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9641" srcset="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/768-606-max.png 768w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/768-606-max-300x237.png 300w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/768-606-max-585x462.png 585w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/768-606-max-100x79.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<p>Learning for Sustainability is also now an integral element of the General Teaching Council of Scotland’s professional values. (9) The rhetoric is that LfS is delivered in a holistic way across all schools and at all levels. The reality is that this is as fanciful as believing Net Zero targets are anything other than glorified greenwash.</p>



<p>A great deal of what LfS represents and the quality of the learning and thinking behind its existence is to be applauded. My concern is that putting so many crucial issues – such as political literacy, issues of peace and conflict, global citizenship, understanding interdependence, and tackling climate change, etc. – in to one tickbox makes these issues seem peripheral to the purposes of mainstream education rather than its central priorities.</p>



<p>It is only by mainlining the adoption of degrowth education (10) that Scotland can begin to move to systems of educational practice that begin to address the multiple emergencies we face. The current focus around degrowth and economic transition, however, is too often set against challenges of moving our economies out of growth and fossil fuel dependency. This underplays the fact that the central transformation we require at a global level is in our hearts and minds. The political right understand this and have successfully overseen the complete capitulation of the curriculum to the market. Bringing the curriculum back in to actual public ownership needs to be central to any strategic approach – not just bringing humanity back from the brink but setting us on a new path altogether. For while our education system is ostensibly a ‘public service’, it has been hijacked by neoliberal, market-orientated perspectives. The result of this process can perhaps be more clearly identified in England and we cannot allow the same catastrophe to befall the system in Scotland.</p>



<p>We can learn how to read and write while we learn right from wrong. We can learn how to count as we learn to understand what counts when it comes to bringing a fairer more ecologically balanced world in to being. While we remain in the imaginary of curricula captured by the market, placing competition above co-operation, pushing fairy tales of growth and technofixes for the world’s dilemmas, there is no space for progress, much less for transformation.</p>



<p>The good news is that if we are to tackle climate change then it means we must address climate justice. If we are to address climate justice, we must address colonialism. To address colonialism, we must be anti-racist and anti-capitalist. Above all, we must address the patriarchal nature of global society and the intersectionality of oppressions that have distorted the human condition for centuries. By addressing these systemic causes of injustice, we undermine the case for militarism and war. These are the stakes at play in our classrooms, homes, and communities. We need an education system focussed on the task of reimagining a better future, not on standardised testing and league tables.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="725" height="1024" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1024-1447-725x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9636" srcset="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1024-1447-725x1024.jpg 725w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1024-1447-212x300.jpg 212w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1024-1447-768x1085.jpg 768w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1024-1447-585x827.jpg 585w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1024-1447-100x141.jpg 100w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1024-1447.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px" /></figure>



<p>During the global pandemic, Naomi Klein asked the newly furloughed classes, those of us who could afford the luxury of isolation, the ones framed in opposition to ‘key workers’:</p>



<p><strong>“What are we if not essential? Are we being kept like pets? For who?”</strong> (1)</p>



<p>At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, 30% of the UK’s workforce was furloughed. (2) For many of the people who make up Scotland’s ‘professional classes’, COVID-19 presented an existential, ideological crisis. As we stayed in our jammies, kneading dough and learning Tiktok dances, there was a realisation of our redundancy. When modern identity is realised through optimisation and productivity, this new reality hurt some egos. Thousands clambered towards a sense of usefulness, with record numbers signing up to lend support in their communities through Volunteer Scotland and the British Red Cross. (3) The term ‘self-isolation’ became locked into our daily lexicon, as we barricaded ourselves inside for 23 hours per day. A hurried exchange with a faceless delivery driver or an hour of daily exercise was the only moment of physical external engagement.</p>



<p>We experienced a novel psychological phenomenon, a new ‘us’ and ‘them’: the key worker and the captive other. There were the real workers, the ones who literally and metaphorically lifted our nation through crisis – supermarket workers, carers, waste collectors, delivery drivers, teachers, healthcare workers. Many ‘professionals’ did not make the cut. In 2013, David Graeber gave a veneer of academic rigour to Tom Leonard’s image of the “liaison coordinator” (4):</p>



<p><strong>“Huge swathes of people, in Europe and North America in particular, spend their entire working lives performing tasks they secretly believe do not really need to be performed. The moral and spiritual damage that comes from this situation is profound. It is a scar across our collective soul.”</strong> (5)</p>



<p>We are in the era of the ‘Bullshit Job’, where cultural aspiration for social mobility and a political drive for closing the attainment gap has encouraged us to present as ambitious and upwardly mobile, regardless of whether the job we aspire towards is useful or not. This often includes the incentive to leave the community that nurtured and sustained us, physically and imaginatively. I grew up under this narrative. It’s an ideology that encourages us to talk about our hometowns as ‘dead ends’, to valorise those who ‘got out’.</p>



<p>The UK Government’s Social Mobility Commission defines ‘social mobility’ as “the link between a person’s occupation or income and the occupation or income of their parents. Where there is a strong link, there is a lower level of social mobility. Where there is a weak link, there is a higher level of social mobility.”</p>



<p>By definition, the weaker your link to your working-class roots, the more ‘successful’ you are. In Scotland’s collective consciousness, there has always been an aspiration for getting up and getting out. According to Tom Devine, an estimated 2.3 million people left Scotland for overseas opportunities between 1825 and 1938 (6): “Scotland’s biggest export in the nineteenth and twentieth century has been people.” (7) This trend of outward migration – or “export” – continued into the twenty-first century, with a population loss of approximately 825,000 between 1952 and 2006. (8) Recognising how our push for social mobility has been a key part of Scotland’s colonial narrative makes us feel uncomfortable. Playing the underdog is part of our nation-building, so the reality of Scotland’s historical role in the UK’s imperial enterprise, and the more recent propagation of the neoliberal agenda around the world, is often avoided. This country is the birthplace of the industrial revolution and the destructive, linear economic ideology that baked-in the whole system of overconsumption, waste, and exploitation.</p>



<p>The pandemic picked scabs that many had tried to ignore. For those of us who took the social mobility pill, and aspired to get up and get on, the revelation that we are not contributing much to society is hard to swallow. Social mobility is typically linked to moving away from traditionally operational and menial occupations into physically sedentary, strategic roles. When our jobs are more paper-pushing than purposeful, the only signifiers of wealth, success, and ‘usefulness’ left available to us are presented through consumption of goods and services. We saw this ideology from the UK Government during the pandemic, with Eat Out To Help Out (9) and easing of restrictions for high-street chain stores – a rally cry for us to consume our way out of economic crisis. At the peak of the pandemic, as the furloughed classes clicked and scrolled, filling our digital baskets to save the economy, the UK’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson stated that “there really <em>is</em> such a thing as society.” (10) Famously, Margaret Thatcher had interjected:</p>



<p><strong>“…and who is society? There is no such thing! There are individual men and women and there are families and no government can do anything except through people and people look to themselves first.”</strong> (11)</p>



<p>It seemed that in the face of a global pandemic, society was the only thing that was real, and we all played our part within it. But what is often overlooked from this infamous interview with Douglas Keay of <em>Woman&#8217;s Own</em> magazine is Thatcher’s ambition for the façade of success expressed through material consumption. When asked what she was personally looking forward to achieving, she replied:</p>



<p><strong>“&#8230;spreading the outward and visible signs of success ever more widely… You have to inspire their own efforts and then not take so much away from them that they have not the chance to go on improving themselves and increasing their personal property to their own and family&#8217;s advantage.”</strong></p>



<p>Boris Johnson may have signed on to society, but when it comes to how that society functions, we are living Thatcher’s blueprint. We work to consume and accumulate signifiers of wealth, i.e. more stuff. The pandemic did not disturb that core truth. In fact, it reinstated consumption as a key pillar of the good society. And as much as having wealth and nice stuff is a real and worthy pursuit for many, the reality of ‘accumulation as success’ has found us consuming approximately 18.4 tonnes of resources per person per annum in Scotland. (12) </p>



<p>We are surrounded by cheap stuff, designed to become obsolete, destined for a long, lonely life in landfill. All the while, as our homes become more cluttered, there’s a growing vacuous space inside ourselves and our communities. Average ratings of life satisfaction and happiness are all declining in the UK, with ratings of happiness in Scotland falling by 1.2% as of March 2020. (13)</p>



<p>The distinction between ‘key workers’ and the rest of us only exacerbated this tension, as David Graeber had identified:</p>



<p><strong>“Real, productive workers are relentlessly squeezed and exploited. The remainder are divided between a terrorised stratum of the, universally reviled, unemployed and a larger stratum who are basically paid to do nothing, in positions designed to make them identify with the perspectives and sensibilities of the ruling class (managers, administrators, etc) – and particularly its financial avatars – but, at the same time, foster a simmering resentment against anyone whose work has clear and undeniable social value.”</strong> (14)</p>



<p>The furloughed classes faced the reality of their own redundancy in the social hierarchy, whilst looking out the window at the hardship faced by key workers, many of whom were also experiencing low pay, job insecurity, and poor working conditions. It was clear that the lives of key workers were simultaneously essential and disposable: healthcare workers without adequate PPE, teaching staff in front of classes but not prioritised for vaccinations, those propping up our supply chains expected to work longer hours in dangerous conditions… As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, 79% of the UK public now believe there is a large gap between different social classes and over half the public think the pandemic has increased social inequality. (15)</p>



<p>We can see it for what it is: an exploitative, empty system that pushes stuff around. A system that truly benefits no one (even the rich!) and pillages our natural world in the process. The social mobility dream makes sense. We want people to have opportunity, jobs, and adequate income, but this cannot be at the expense of our planetary boundaries. Without any meaningful reduction on resource consumption, all our social mobility ambitions are just working towards equal opportunities for anyone, from any background, to have the chance to exploit other people and the planet and harm their own wellbeing in the process.</p>



<p>There is an environmental imperative to decouple social mobility from growth and resource consumption. If Scotland is serious about reducing resource consumption, then we must wrestle with our materialistic culture, which is directly linked to aspiration and social mobility. People with more money consume more stuff: “around half the emissions of the richest 10% (24.5% of global emissions) are associated with the consumption of citizens of North America and the EU”, and “in the past 20-30 years, more carbon has been emitted by the “consumption [habits] of the already affluent, rather than lifting people out of poverty.” (16)</p>



<p>At present, we enjoy the benefits of our colonial past, continuing to push the environmental, social, and economic burden of our mass consumption on to the countries we import our products from. Our reliance on overseas economies for our stuff allows us to also export the carbon emissions associated with their production. Around 46% of the UK’s carbon footprint is emissions released overseas to satisfy UK-based consumption, and this figure is not accounted for in national reporting of our emissions. (17) Moreover, when the electronics, clothing, and plastic toys are broken or out of fashion, we send much of the waste back overseas for someone else to deal with.(18)</p>



<p>Right now, we are trying to put ourselves and our communities back together after a global pandemic. But during this process, and as the UN’s COP26 environmental conference comes to Glasgow in November 2021, there is much reflection on what its ‘Building Back Better’ looks like for Scotland. For Zero Waste Scotland’s ‘Decoupling Advisory Group’, which brought together a range of independent thinkers from across Scotland and beyond, solutions must focus on “reducing Scotland’s consumption of goods and materials absolutely, rapidly, permanently and fairly” (19) and decoupling economic growth from resource use. We need to see a logic of “care and repair” (20) built into government policy, into our businesses, and communities. We need wellbeing and meaningful work to be at the centre of our economic system, if we have any chance of saving ourselves from drudgery, mental health problems, and growing inequality.</p>



<p>All our lives we have been told that we modern consumers are magpies, always scraping and searching for the next shiny thing. But it turns out that the link between consumerism and wellbeing is about as real as the thieving-magpie myth: it turns out magpies do not steal shiny things, but in fact have “neophobia – fear of new things”. (21) We are not magpies, and we do not need to be defined by tired myths of aspiration as the accumulation of stuff. If the pandemic has taught us anything, it’s that we long for meaningful connection, that we want to cultivate our communities and nurture skills to play a part in society. We have a chance to reframe social mobility away from consumption, creating aspiration to lead a meaningful life, with security, happiness, and freedom at its heart. It all starts with stepping away from stuff.</p>

<p><strong><em>Territorial struggle and prefigurative politics were evident at the Pollok Free State in the 1990s, opening up new possibilities beyond protest. To mark the occasion of COP26 taking place in Glasgow, Pablo Routledge, Gehan Macleod and David Lees write how a new Govan Declaration of Independence </em>– <em>a Govan Free State at GalGael </em>–<em> is creating a space for gathering and pose critical questions about power and political imagination in a time of climate emergency.</em></strong></p>

<p>This November, Glasgow will be hosting the 26<sup>th</sup> United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) meeting – or Conference of Parties (COP 26). Previous COP meetings over the past 25 years have yielded few enforceable agreements, while greenhouse gas emissions have soared globally, precipitating climate breakdown.</p>



<p>The COP26 meeting in Glasgow comes at a critical time given the accentuation of the climate emergency across the world. In this year alone, we have witnessed the lethal and destructive power of wild fires across the Western United States, Siberia, Greece, Turkey, and Italy; floods in China, Australia, Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands; record winter storms in Spain and the US; hurricane, cyclone, and large storm impacts in the US, Fiji, Indonesia, and the UK; and dust storms in China.</p>



<p>While government negotiators will meet in Glasgow sequestered from the general public, protestors from around the world will congregate in the city to demand climate justice. Climate justice foregrounds how participation and accountability can come into conversation with the need for sustainability and social justice. This recognises the interconnectedness of the issues underlying capitalism – namely, that ecological destruction and economic domination in the name of profits and growth, as well as racial, gender, and class oppressions, are the key drivers of social and environmental injustice.</p>



<p>Such injustices have a long and complex history of having been resisted in different ways across the planet. One form of resistance against environmental injustice and exploitation has come in the form of ‘free states’ and ‘autonomous zones’ of various kinds. Indeed, the notion of free states as spaces of autonomy, communing, and engagement has a long and rich activist history.</p>



<p>In the early 1990s, Pollok Free State was created as a protest encampment in Glasgow as part of mobilisations against the construction of the M77 motorway in the city. These in turn formed part of a broader wave of anti-roads protests that emerged in the UK during the 1990s, challenging the Tory government’s road building programme<strong>.</strong></p>



<p>Pollok Free State was an encampment of tree houses, tents, and benders (do-it-yourself dwellings) located in the Barrhead woods of Pollok Estate in the path of the projected motorway. Located south of Glasgow’s River Clyde, the Free State was sited amidst several low-income housing estates, including those of Pollok, Corkerhill, and Arden. Emerging in 1992&nbsp;out of the actions of Colin Macleod, an Earth First! activist and Pollok resident, the camp acted as a visible symbol of resistance to the motorway. It stood as a critique of the environmental damage caused by road building and an example of how people might live their lives differently, issuing its own passports as symbols of autonomy from the British state, more than four years before the Scottish parliament was inaugurated. <em>Pollok Free State </em>would go on to inspire many and for years to come, and morphed into the GalGael Trust (1) in Govan, a community organisation which Colin saw as a modern day people reclaiming the right to self-determination.</p>



<p>Free States and autonomous zones symbolically announce the act of claiming, bordering, and making space, as well as the contestation over land use. (2) The making of space in such zones involves various objectives and operations, including establishing media and communications infrastructures that provide mainstream media tents, liaisons, and activist media alongside everyday protest activities that constitute the free states as sites of social reproduction. These include legal, medical, and activist trauma support; governance infrastructures such as meeting spaces, announcement boards, decision-making policy guidelines etc.; and activities that reproduce everyday life in the camps such as dealing with food supply, cooking, shelter, sanitation, and the maintenance of communal and private space.(3)</p>



<p>In France, for example, <em>Zones a</em>&nbsp;<em>Defendre</em> (Zones of Defence, or ZADs) have emerged over the past decade at various locations across the country protesting destructive developments and calling for climate justice. One example is the <a href="https://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2018/05/06/from-paris-to-nantes-state-violence-1968-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZAD at <em>Notre-Dame-des-Landes</em> (near Nantes)</a> constructed on nearly 5,000 acres of wetlands, farmland, and hamlets to protest the construction of an airport planned by the French government in partnership with Vinci’s (the world’s largest multinational construction firm). As an integral part of their resistance, this ZAD has practiced creative alternatives to resource extraction through cultivating crop rotations of wheat and buckwheat, and establishing a textile workshop, microbrewery, and bakery. (4) As a result of the solidarity forged between local farmers and climate justice activists in their resistance to attacks by armed police and other forms of state repression, the airport was shelved in 2018.</p>



<p>More recently, in 2020, in Seattle (US), hundreds of activists, who had been demonstrating against police brutality since the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, converged on the Capital Hill neighbourhood of the city and set up a peaceful occupied protest. There, they distributed free food and medical supplies, planted community gardens, and held film screenings and workshops. The area was declared the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone and later the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP). During its brief duration, the CHOP was a police-free, self-governing utopia. A food co-op and medics’ corner were established and there were classes, lectures, speakers, poetry, live music, and huge works of art created.</p>



<p>For journalist and political theorist Raul Zibechi, the art of making space in community-based struggles potentially enables a dispersal of power from the state and capital. (5)The social relations generated comprise spaces “in which to build a new social organisation collectively, where new subjects take shape and materially and symbolically appropriate their space.” (6) In Zibechi’s view, territory is <em>the</em> crucial space in which contentious politics are fashioned, understood as both material territory (involving struggles over the access, control, use, and configuration of environmental resources such as land, soil, water, biodiversity, as well as the physical territory of communities, infrastructure, etc.) and immaterial territory (involving struggles over ideas, knowledges, beliefs, conceptions of the world, etc.). (7) For indigenous peoples, inclusive of the relationship to their land and communities, territorial struggles comprise resistance to the theft of land and other resources and the appropriation by capital and the state of indigenous sovereignty. (8)</p>



<p>Such ‘territorial’ struggles are conceptualised by Zibechi as “societies in movement”, defined through their creation of social relations of autonomy characterised by the (re)appropriation of resources, increased potentials for co-operation and transversal connection, the generation of new types of knowledge and capacities that facilitate self-organisation, and more horizontalist (i.e. non-hierarchical) organisational forms. (9) Many of these characteristics have been termed forms of ‘prefigurative politics’ (i.e. living now the future that is desired). The spaces they make represent ‘commons’ – resources that are collectively owned or shared between people and the relational power generated by folk acting and being-in-common. (10)</p>



<p>Making and creating space is also about articulating the symbolic significance of particular spaces and the protests that take place within them. Practices of prefigurative politics, or ‘societies in movement’, symbolise the disruption of and a resistance to neoliberal capital accumulation and the attendant climate breakdown, articulating alternatives to the status quo.</p>



<p>In our age of climate emergency, all struggles for climate justice become prefigurative territorial struggles in one way or another. For example, struggles by farmers’ movements in the majority world for food sovereignty (i.e. farmers’ control over the means of environmentally sustainable and culturally appropriate food production) take claiming and/or defence of land as a starting point for struggle. Struggles for community-owned energy renewables require a territorial basis for the siting and production of that energy, such as with the<em> Energiewende</em> (energy transition) in Germany. (11)</p>



<p>Many of the characteristics outlined above – including territorial struggle and prefigurative politics – were evident at the <em>Pollok Free State </em>in the 1990s. The act of declaring a free state opened up new possibilities beyond protest: new imaginaries, new forms of discourse. It was undoubtedly a site of social reproduction – something that is still true of GalGael today. As COP convenes for a 26th occasion, and as GalGael prepare to celebrate our 25th year, we could not escape the irony in the convention landing a few blocks away from our workshop. With UN and UK law poised to displace Scots law in the Blue and Green zones for the duration of COP, we thought it fitting to mark the occasion by declaring independence anew, with a <a href="http://www.govanfreestate.scot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Govan Free State.</a></p>



<p>Colin Macleod would come to describe Pollok Free State as a leading question, asking “Where is our democracy? Where is our parliament?” (12) Much has taken place in the past 25 years, but too little has changed. <a href="http://www.govanfreestate.scot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Govan Free State</a> will pose similar critical questions about power and political imagination in the face of climate collapse – questions set alight by the winds of wildfires and a global pandemic. We want to divest of our faith in the instruments and institutions that seem unable to respond adequately, while acknowledging the many people with tender intentions caught up in these mechanics. We will look to constitute a ’convergence space’ (13) of community members, activists, ideas, dialogue, and creativity, where folks will articulate together shared concerns and collective visions to generate a politics of solidarity founded on common ground.</p>



<p>A Govan Declaration of Independence, framed by a critical understanding of interdependence and radical dependence, will bring a wholly different aspect to the multitude of grassroots initiatives taking place in the city. Through it, we will playfully explore the notion of nations and states, alongside what it means to be a people of plural heritages. We want to explore practices to reclaim responsibility for the contested territories of our collective futures. The statement “<em>declare yourself welcome</em>” will define the borders of our territories. We’ll print and issue our own passports and make our own ceremonial ‘objects of state’. We’ll also invite others to declare their own Free States and hope to launch a downloadable <em>Declare Yourself A Free State </em>pack, a template for a constellation of distributed Free States. This is an invitation to “decolonise yersel” – be that your bedroom, your tenement close, your street, your community garden, however you might choose to define your territory – in a declaration of hope, of intent, of solidarity to counter fatalism and fire radical imagination.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="400" height="600" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BellaGFS-400x600-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9575" srcset="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BellaGFS-400x600-1.png 400w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BellaGFS-400x600-1-200x300.png 200w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BellaGFS-400x600-1-100x150.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></figure>



<p>Here in Govan, in the midst of an existence wrought with inter-generational trauma and unprocessed pain, we will gather ourselves and our practices of collective grieving – needed now more than ever as climate catastrophes coalesce. In the face of so many false solutions and uncertainty, we hope to create experiences of quiet, depth, and meaning so as to process harsh realities and draw strength.</p>



<p>Our <a href="http://www.govanfreestate.scot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Govan Free State</a> gatherings will also reclaim cultural inheritances and remember our own traditions, folklore, songs. Inspired by thinkers such as Hamish Henderson his ‘Freedom Come-All-Ye’ (14) and evoking the tradition of hospitality, the Free State will breathe life into discourse centred on our emancipation, independence, and international reconciliation through shared space, food, and music.</p>



<p>We note that COP26 starts near the time of All Hallows, All Saints, and the much older <em>Samhai</em>n – a Gaelic liminal or threshold festival marking the end of the four quarters of the Celtic year. It is a seasonal time of waning light and of passing over, a time for the death of old systems – and perhaps the birth of new worlds? We will also invoke older laws and traditional practices from the Althing (assembly fields) of Iceland or the Udal Law of Shetland and Orkney or, closer, from the ancient law mound of Doomster Hill here in Govan. We will make oaths to wild places, dying species, and more climate vulnerable communities and peoples. And we will explore with curiosity traditional forms of gathering and place-making, such as the ancient practice of the <em>aonach</em>, or great assembly.</p>



<p>By reclaiming territories, material and immaterial, we seek to stand with other indigenous peoples globally and all those left vulnerable, marginalised, or brutalised by the growing extremities of wealth and weather or many other forms of violence. Our hope is that the Free State will extend a gesture ‘beyond itself’ (15) and even beyond Glasgow. Such spaces consist of a series of spatially distributed acts and processes: those physically present are always part of more spatially extensive virtual and digital networks of support and organisation.</p>



<p>Political activities of alliance can open up the political order for challenge, through visible, embodied acts of resistance. Alliance building for climate justice must also invent ways of saying, seeing, and being, that nurture a politics of affinity, and that engender new forms of collective and inclusive enunciation, engendering new subjects for the uncertain futures that await us all.</p>

<p><strong><em>Decarbonise, democratise, decolonise, decommodify. This is the mantra we must adopt in the year of COP26, argues Benjamin Brown. Nowhere is this more true  than for Mossmorran, a scar on Scotland’s environmental conscience.</em></strong></p>



<p><em>“</em><em>Tae conclude ma tale I’m gey sick o their lees,</em></p>



<p><em>The truth is they juist dae whitever they please,</em></p>



<p><em>When it disnae blaw up we’re tae faa on our knees,</em></p>



<p><em>Tae gie thanks tae the Mossmorran Gaffer!”</em></p>



<p>&#8211; From <em>The Mossmorran Gaffer</em> by Wullie Hershaw (1)</p>



<p>A towering jumble of metallic pipes and chimneys, bathed in smoke, rises up from the Fife landscape. This industrial monolith is a cavernous presence, standing tall in an uneasy truce with gorse-strewn fields that surround it. Intermittently, the site is lit up by flares burning off excess gas. These can burn so bright that they are visible from Edinburgh, over twenty miles away across the Firth of Forth. But it is up-close that the presence of this place can be felt most keenly. The incessant, whirring din of industrial machinery; the unpleasant smell that permeates the air around it.</p>



<p>This is the Mossmorran petrochemical complex, processing gas from the North Sea into ethylene and other chemical products. Mossmorran refers to both the natural gas and liquids (NGL) plant operated by Shell, and Exxonmobil’s ethylene plant that sits alongside it. Since its construction in 1985, Mossmorran has seen opposition from a sizeable chunk of Fife residents unconvinced that the jobs associated with the plants (180 employees plus 50 contractors at the ethylene plant, according to Exxonmobil (2); numbers for Shell’s NGL plant are not publicly available) are a price worth paying for year upon year of light, air, and noise pollution. Symptoms reported include heightened anxiety, itchy throats, asthma, headaches and migraines, and sleepless nights from light and noise disruption caused by flaring.</p>



<p>Local campaigners have held protests, conducted social impact mapping (3), and submitted over 900 complaints (4) about the environmental and health impacts of the plants. This has delivered some wins: Shell UK Limited and Exxonmobil Chemical Limited have both been fined by the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) for breaching environmental regulations at the site. In May 2019, residents pushed for the regional council to “commission an independent expert study of the environmental, social and health impacts on the surrounding communities”. (5) A council motion was subsequently passed which includes a commitment to “seek discussions with the Scottish and UK Governments, the companies and trade unions regarding the long term future of the plant and a possible strategy for its decommissioning”.</p>



<p>This is not mere NIMBYism. Although local disruption and health concerns may have animated initial grievances, campaigners increasingly join the dots between climate breakdown and Mossmorran, which boasts the unenviable position of being the third largest polluter in Scotland (6). Indeed, Exxonmobil’s promise to install a new ground flare tip has been met with derision. Protests stubbornly continued throughout the pandemic (both online and socially distanced), and the cosmetic solutions put forward have failed to mute public criticism. At the end of July, as restrictions eased, local campaigners welcomed over 100 climate activists from across Scotland, who converged in a nondescript field close to Mossmorran as part of an ‘Action Weekend’ organised by Climate Camp Scotland and local group Actions Speak Louder Than Words. The camp was planned as part of a coordinated wave of actions in over 20 countries against the use of fossil gas (7), and to mobilise action against Scotland’s fossil fuel infrastructure.</p>



<p>From activists standing against the Torness nuclear power station near Dunbar in 1979 (8), to the occupation of Mainshill wood to prevent opencast coal mining in 2009, (9) Scotland has a strong tradition of using protest camps to block environmental harm. Yet the pandemic created many challenges, with activist energy understandably turning to public health, mutual aid, and care over much of the past year and a half. Organisers scaled back their original vision, abandoning plans for an <a href="https://www.ende-gelaende.org/en/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ende Gelaende</a> (10) style mass direct action so as to prioritise covid safety (11) and create a space for the Scottish climate movement to regroup after sixteen months of dormancy.</p>



<p>The organising process that led up to this was not always easy. Familiar patterns of burnout, uneven burdens of labour, and miscommunication were compounded by the limitations of mostly online meetings and other constraints imposed by the pandemic. Organising fell short of ambitions to ensure inclusivity, causing upset to people with disabilities in the run-up to the camp. Efforts were made to remedy this, but it exposed shortcomings that must be overcome for any intersectional climate movement.</p>



<p>However, relationships of trust were gradually built between local campaigners and climate camp organisers. As covid restrictions loosened, outreach stalls in Fife created opportunities for learning, discussion, and dialogue with the community. The climate camp itself brought together activists from across Scotland: Fife, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dundee, Stirling, Argyll. The weekend was tightly packed with a vibrant programme of workshops and action planning, culminating with a public assembly at the gates of Mossmorran. Protesters expressed their discontent loudly, noisily, and passionately: <em>“Clean Gas is a Dirty Lie! Just Transition Now! Polluters Out!”</em></p>



<p>A movement was rising.</p>

<p>The COP26 (UN Climate Change Conference) circus arrives in Glasgow this November. “Just Transition” (12) is now centre stage in national policy-making under Scotland’s new SNP-Green collaborative government, while UK PM Boris Johnson has recently sought to bolster climate credentials by announcing that fossil fuels will be eliminated from the UK’s electricity supply by 2035. (13) Yet talk comes easy, and consensus over the exact meaning of what this transition should entail remains to be determined. SNP proposals for a £26 million Energy Transition Zone near Aberdeen are a far cry from the priorities of local residents, who are concerned the project will transform one of the area’s last green spaces into another industrial site, (14) and politicians of all stripes remain captivated by false solutions such as carbon offsets, (15) blue hydrogen, (16) and Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (17). </p>



<p>Concerns remain that the second iteration of the Scottish Government’s Just Transition Commission will privilege business, while marginalising the voices of trade unions and local communities. Meanwhile, Britain’s gas crisis has exposed how reliant the economy continues to be on gas, and hikes to energy bills threaten to plunge thousands into fuel poverty.</p>



<p>In Fife’s post-industrial towns of Cowdenbeath and Lochgelly, where the ghosts of once-booming collieries loom large over the landscape, a Green Industrial Revolution holds the promise of economic renewal. Yet the region’s own recent history speaks to the challenges of realising this reality: the BiFab debacle, in which fabrication yards in Burntisland (just a few miles from Mossmorran) lost out on construction contracts for Scotland’s offshore wind industry to companies overseas (<a href="https://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2019/07/01/bifab-and-the-neart-na-gaoithe-offshore-wind-farm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relying on cheapened Indonesian labour</a>) (18), was a painful reminder that the government cannot rely on the private sector to deliver green jobs of its own volition. Coordinated public investment and active state intervention will be vital to ensure the creation of secure, well paid, unionised jobs in low carbon industries.</p>



<p>Navigating a socially and environmentally just transition, that can bring prosperity to economically deprived regions in Scotland without relying on endless extractivism and exploitative supply chains, is a fraught process. It will not be easy. Yet one thing is certain: any ‘Just Transition’ worth its salt will not be determined by Shell or Exxonmobil, whatever superficial aspiration to “net zero emissions” they embrace (19). These are the same companies who have for years have funded climate denial, committed human rights abuses, and contaminated air, land, and seas across the world. From Indonesia to Nigeria, they are the perpetrators of carbon colonialism and fossil fuel capitalism (20). Rather than banking on industry “partnership” to deliver the change we need, a true “Just Transition” requires public participation, far-sighted planning, and full democratisation of the energy sector. To decarbonise at the speed and scale required, public ownership must triumph over market logic and the race to generate profits.</p>



<p>The climate camp stimulated a process of visioning for our own collective future. This extended beyond conventional definitions of “Just Transition”, to embrace much more expansive and holistic ideas about how we live and work together. Ultimately, it recognised that we cannot simply demand ‘green jobs’. We need to redesign the basic principles around which our economy operates. As Kathi Weeks highlights, “the wage relation generates not just income and capital, but disciplined individuals, governable subjects, worthy citizens, and responsible family members.” (21) Class antagonisms remain under capitalism, even if it adopts a green veneer, and if we want to achieve true social and ecological flourishing, we must look to ways of working less, consuming less, and dismantling the social, racial, and gender hierarchies that pit all of us against each other.</p>



<p><em>Decarbonise, democratise, decolonise, decommodify</em> – looking forward into the 2020s, this should be the mantra that guides us. Zero carbon, publicly owned energy systems. Free public transport. Universal Basic Services. Debt cancellation, climate reparations, and a radical redistribution of wealth and power from corporations to communities.</p>



<p>From record-breaking floods to devastating wildfires (22), the climate crisis is intensifying. The dire situation we find ourselves in at just 1°C of global heating is a warning of what awaits us without radical action. There are many uphill struggles, but it’s important to recognise how far we’ve come. Successful direct action campaigns against coal and fracking have made support for those industries untenable in the UK. Pressure from youth activists has prompted Nicola Sturgeon to ditch ‘maximum economic recovery of North Sea oil and gas’ in favour of ‘the fastest possible just transition.’ (23)</p>



<p>While the struggle at Mossmorran is far from won, it illuminates how we must bend the political calculations that will shape our collective future. To dismantle Scotland’s petro-industrial complex and build a world that is not just liveable but <em>desirable</em>, we need to go beyond resistance. We need to open up political space for degrowth and ecosocialist ideas to become the new ‘common sense’. As the late anthropologist David Graeber reminds us: “the ultimate, hidden truth of the world is that it is something that we make, and could just as easily make differently.” (24) It’s time: let’s build the future we deserve.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Hello world. Welcome to Glasgow. Welcome to Scotland. We are drawing on Glasgow’s radical past to inject hope and urgency into the moribund COP process.</strong><br><br>YOUR VISION OF our country may be an idealised one of lochs brimming with salmon and glens filled with deer, but in reality we’re a petro-chemical economy being held ransom by the British State. Our most famous icons and exports – our salmon and deer and grouse – are really symbols of a country disfigured by landed power. We remain a semi-feudal nation with one of the most unequal distributions of land ownership in the world. </p>



<p>In Gaelic, Glasgow means ‘Dear Green Place’, but Glasgow was also known from the 19th century as the Second City of the Empire, a city that became synonymous with massive expansion, global trade, industry, invention, and shipbuilding. </p>



<p>For almost 200 years, the statue of the celebrated Scottish inventor and engineer James Watt has stood in George Square. Every schoolchild is taught about the invention of the steam engine in 1776, which was fundamental to the changes brought by the Industrial Revolution across the world. What’s less well known is that Watt’s father was a slave trader, a colonial merchant who subsidised his son. The development of the steam engine was funded by slavery. Watt himself was involved in colonial commerce and played a direct role in the trafficking of enslaved people. </p>



<p>With Glasgow playing host to the COP in 2021, we have historical symmetry. It’s more of a loop than a continuum; as the world faces climate catastrophe, the same city that was pivotal in the Industrial Revolution, colonisation, and Empire is the city that must now be the pivot towards decolonisation and degrowth. </p>



<p>Mirroring the challenge facing humanity itself, the city of Glasgow needs to find ways to move beyond the old story that it has become defined by. This is not just about moving beyond an industrial legacy and identity; it’s about moving beyond a history of violence and ongoing destruction. Like the abandoned coalfields that pockmark Fife and Ayrshire, the empty docks that still line the Clyde speak to communities left to mass unemployment and intergenerational trauma. For Glasgow, and for the rest of us, degrowth is about finding ways of living and being beyond our obsession with productivity and consumption and GDP. It’s about working towards a radical&nbsp;transformation of our society to one which serves a new function: supporting the flourishing and sustaining of life. </p>



<p>The path towards this transformation or ‘transition’ is faint and hard to make out. Any movement of change left to market forces motivated by profits and constrained within the economics of globalisation – a political and economic ideology based on exploitative practices towards people, land, and nature – will follow the same inevitable path to destruction. After a year in the trauma of the pandemic, the climate crisis came to Europe. Extreme weather visited the Global North with an unrecognisable summer of flooding, wildfires, and extreme heat. Even the most complacent were woken from their slumbers to confront a present and future of climate emergency that can no longer be ignored. We are heading full steam into a world of fossil-fuel expansion and mass extinction of species, including our own. As the IPPC report stated, we are living in “code red for humanity: the alarm bells are deafening, and the evidence is irrefutable.” </p>



<p>Yet, incredibly, the Prime Minister – of the UK government Scotland did not elect – is preparing to sign off on a new drilling permit at Cambo oilfield, west of Shetland.1 If approved, Cambo would produce 170m barrels of oil and would deepen the climate crisis for decades to come. [2] It is a staggeringly backward move, an exercise in futility and, ultimately, a crime against humanity. In Scotland, we don’t have full democratic control over our future path, and in this situation there is an echo of the climate predicament. In a world where greenwash and disinformation dominate, it’s easy to feel alienated and see only the futility of the process. </p>



<p>The COP26 Coalition joined calls for the summit’s postponement, stating: <br><br><strong>“As the clock ticks on this crucial decade, rich countries must commit to doing their fair share of climate action, cutting emissions to zero and paying their carbon debt to the global South. This is the bare minimum needed to pave the way for a successful COP26, yet the COP Presidency is far from showing such leadership [&#8230;] From climate to Covid the UK has shown it is willing to sacrifice those worst off to shore up huge profits for the few.” [3] </strong></p>



<p>The challenge is not to be consumed by the huge gravitational pull and distraction of COP – its hype, its false hope, its unreality, its greenwashed credentials and stagemanaged accords. The challenge is to organise within communities and resist the police state, to speak the truth, to cultivate outrage, to create a rupture, to challenge inevitability, and to imagine, articulate, and build different futures. Our humantiy and our home is under threat. </p>



<p><strong>BEING HUMAN </strong></p>



<p>IF, AS THE IPCC stated: “All pathways begin now and involve rapid and unprecedented social transformation”, then Glasgow has a radical political history to inspire the movement. </p>

<p>Glasgow is not just a city of Empire built on exploitation; it is also a city built on struggle. Whether it’s Mary Barbour’s rent strikes or John Maclean and Red Clydeside in the early 20th century, Jimmy Reid and the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders of 1971, the anti-Polaris and CND movement, the Anti-Poll Tax Campaign, the anti-apartheid movement, Pollok Free State in the 1990s, the Kenmure Street protest of 2021 or the countless unsung pockets of radical and inspired action in the communities that make up the fabric of the city, there is much to learn from Glasgow’s radical past. </p>



<p>Other sources of local inspiration include Jimmy Reid’s Rectorial Address to the University of Glasgow in 1972, a speech that has had reverberations and resonance down the years. He could be speaking to us directly today: </p>



<p><strong>“Let me right at the outset define what I mean by alienation. It is the cry of men who feel themselves the victims of blind economic forces beyond their control. It is the frustration of ordinary people excluded from the processes of decision making. The feeling of despair and hopelessness that pervades people who feel with justification that they have no real say in shaping or determining their own destinies. [&#8230;] Reject these attitudes. Reject the values and false morality that underlie these attitudes. A rat race is for rats. We’re not rats. We’re human beings.” </strong></p>



<p>Some of the critique of the climate crisis turns on humanity; claiming, with the spectre of ecofascism looming, that “We humans are the problem.”. The answer for Reid is not less humanity but less capitalism. The power structures that have emerged threaten and undermine our hard won democratic rights. His words echo down the ages: </p>



<p><strong>“Government by the people for the people becomes meaningless unless it includes major economic decision making by the people for the people. This is not simply an economic matter. In essence it is an ethical and moral question, for whoever decisions in society ipso facto determines the social priorities of that society.” </strong></p>



<p>Our global economy is structured so that disproportionate, dangerous, and unprecedented amounts of wealth and power are centralised and held by the people and multi-national corporations involved in excessive extractive industries driving climate breakdown and ecosystem collapse. They are taking decisions which are not in the interests of you, me, or the billions of people and diverse ecosystems on this planet. In degrowth, we have an opportunity to transfer power away from those bodies towards more democratic structures and processes that centre care and lifesustaining work. We need to shift towards an economy away from growth-at-anycost to an economy that is feminist in the sense of the late Scottish economist Ailsa Mackay [4] and as outlined by Maria Mies [5] : </p>



<p><strong>“The feminist project is basically an anarchist movement which does not want to replace one (male) power elite by another (female) power elite, but which wants to build up a non-hierarchical, non-centralised society where no elite lives off exploitation and dominance over others.” </strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="989" height="1024" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1931-2000-max-989x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9523" srcset="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1931-2000-max-989x1024.jpg 989w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1931-2000-max-290x300.jpg 290w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1931-2000-max-768x795.jpg 768w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1931-2000-max-1483x1536.jpg 1483w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1931-2000-max-585x606.jpg 585w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1931-2000-max-1170x1212.jpg 1170w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1931-2000-max-100x104.jpg 100w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1931-2000-max.jpg 1931w" sizes="(max-width: 989px) 100vw, 989px" /></figure>



<p>We also need new mechanisms to sustainably ‘govern the commons’, as sketched out by Elinor Ostrom [6] – which include restoring our oceans and the atmosphere in service of the greater good. Any framework for transitioning to an alternative economic system that does not account for the massive global restructuring of power relations needed – and which does not understand this as a political project – will not deliver the transformation that is needed for everyone – human and more-thanhuman – to live well and flourish on the planet we call home.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We present to you LESS’s ‘Code Red’ issue not simply as a response to the COP, but as a space for voices from the centre to the margins of the struggle for climate justice, degrowth, and decolonisation.</p>



<p> Benjamin Brown makes the case for shutting down the Mossmorran Natural Gas Liquids plant in Fife. Paul Routledge, Gehan Macleod, and David Lees write about the GalGael Free State as an autonomous zone near the ‘blue zone’ where climate talks are talking place. Luke Devlin interviews Craig Bryce about rebel DIY housebuilding and the autonomy that comes with building collectives. Rhyddian Knight interviews David Blair about the ark he built on the Cowal peninsula to highlight the plight of coastal communities. Peter Kitelo Chongeywo of the Ogiek Indigenous Forest Peoples of Mount Elgon, Kenya, sees climate change activism in the UK as fighting for all our tomorrows. Kate Chambers writes about the need to decouple social mobility from resource consumption. Mark Langdon reflects on education for transformation as a crucial tool in a time of ecological and social crisis. Svenja Meyerricks interviews climate justice activist Nomalizo Xhoma in Johannesburg about the COP and community struggles in South Africa. Catriona Spaven-Donn argues for commons food systems that are grounded in collaborative relationships between plants and fungi. And, finally, Vishwam Heckert reflects on the need to unlearn Empire and abstraction and disconnection by unlearning the embodied and psychic habit of separating ‘us’ and ‘them’ or ‘me’ from the ‘world’. </p>



<p>The Dear Green Place is the perfect venue for COP, where all the contradictions and complexities of our past, present, and possible futures are laid bare. Glasgow is a site of both colonisation and decolonisation, imperialism and anti-imperialism. It is a city disfigured by poverty and scarred by violence, exploitation, and trauma. It is also a city of resistance, hospitality, political radicalism, and hope. From Glasgow, we need to forge a world where we are no longer “the victims of blind economic forces beyond our control.” [7]&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The choice is endless growth of global capital or life on earth. It’s a choice we are each going to have to keep fighting for every day.<br><br><strong>COP DISTRIBUTION</strong></p>

<p>This collaborative essay reflects multiple voices on degrowth from a Highlands and Islands, or&nbsp; Gàidhealtachd, perspective. From Loch Ness to Caithness, Ullapool to the Isle of Skye, we are a ‘rurally syndicated’ gathering of women – artists, researchers, educators, producers, programmers, practitioners – each living and working in communities across this vast, dispersed and diverse region. Some of us have grown up here, some of us have lived and worked here for many years and others are finding our belonging in this place, having made our home here much more recently.</p>



<p>In the context of Scotland’s centralised, urbanised and growth-oriented society, the Highlands and Islands are viewed by many as ‘on the edge.’ With today’s unprecedented post-Covid economic decline and the loss of widespread EU funding through Brexit, there are many socio-economic challenges facing the marginalised communities of this region. The entangled legacies of coloniality and the effects of growth capitalism are strongly implicated in these challenges: inequitable patterns of land ownership, lack of access to housing, fragile local economies, the impacts of over-tourism, the decline of Gaelic in its heartlands and the commodification of history, culture and creativity. Primary industries have rescinded, while service industries have grown.</p>



<p>In this essay we suggest that the Highlands and Islands have a vital role to play in Scotland’s degrowth future. Degrowth is a way of naming a vision and practice that describes the kinds of relationships between people, resources and power that foster community resilience, ecological stewardship, democratised decision making, creativity and conviviality. We reflect here on where we each see the roots and shoots of degrowth emerging in our own places, lives, work and practice as a plurality of possibilities.<br><br>Firstly, <strong>Cáit O’Neill McCullagh </strong>reflects from her home in Easter Ross on how this collaboration, <em>the gathering, </em>began. Currently researching with communities connecting heritage and learning towards sustainability in Orkney and Shetland, Cáit practices co-curating as a public ethnology, co-producing exhibitions, films and new writing with people across the Highlands and Islands (see New Connections Across the Northern Isles) (1). She has curated in museums in Lismore, Ross and Inverness.</p>

<p><strong>THE GATHERING<br></strong>Meeting to share news, inspirations, concerns, and ideas for ways of working together – via video calls and inevitable ‘DMs’ – <em>the gathering</em> appears like so many of the cyber-ventures that have emerged due to the conditions of Covid-19. In a newly-focused world of blended learning and Zoom seminars, ‘community transmission’ – once mediated from mouths to ears, and in the tacit sharing of everyday living, but now a source of viral fear – is increasingly virtual. Yet, we see now that <em>the gathering</em> was also another adaptive step into the ongoing of a ‘carrying stream’ (after Hamish Henderson). (2) This <em>carrying</em> is the continuum of Highlands and Islands traditions and practices nurtured, through times, as particular responses in specific environments. These practices express the critical and creative adaptivity of those who have been able and/or have chosen to <em>stay</em> here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We live in northern latitudes susceptible to the extremes of the anthropogenic climate crisis. We also inhabit the legacies of inequitable and unjust land ownership patterns. Our open and fragile ecologies are vulnerable to successive iterations of extractive enterprise – including single species afforestation, fossil fuel entanglements and mass tourism. These anthropocene traces challenge relational living between people, and between people and place, abstracting our relationships to nature. Additionally, our geography appears to predispose living in dispersed, atomised communities. Yet, this seeming wildness – or candidate ‘re-wilding’ of often once-peopled land – owes more to long, localised genealogies of Imperialism. These ‘uncanny hauntings’ (3) of multiple colonialisms – internal and worldly complicit – and historicities of peripheral positioning by agents outwith our locale, influence life here, yet. Over time, these influences have contributed both to diminishing local populations and to undermining opportunities to sustain ecologically, culturally, politically and materially.<br><br>There are other ways of seeing that these lenses of environments, historicities and social actions afford. These include considering the historic <em>needs </em>of people making home in our places – living in collaborative, seasonally attuned conviviality – as <em>gifts</em> of becoming<em>.</em> Cooperating for growing, harvesting, weaving, for the empirical development of knowledges about where fish will shoal, which plants will heal, and for discerning how and where to stay and make dwelling, the community transmissions of knowledge-in-language cultures – expressed in story, music, visual arts and performance –&nbsp; have often knit people in our places into highly socially connective communities.</p>



<p><em>The gathering</em> represents what Ivan Illich (1981) has identified as ‘critical technology.’ (4) Like the <em>cèilidh</em>, <em>hairst</em> and <em>hamefaerin,</em> it is another iteration of such knowledge sharing. Practicing ‘potential history’ (5), we gather to share useful pasts, consider how these contribute to and renovate present knowledges, and imagine assembling possible futures. <em>The gathering</em> emerged from friendships founded on these shared interests, and our various ways of nurturing and deliberating them through creative, critical work in an ‘undercommons’ – <em>with</em> and <em>for</em> people (6). Alongside and in communities, we work in arts, heritages, and learning and research. By deliberating collaboratively our communal actions and the meanings we make of them in these ‘spaces of appearance’ (7), we open up the traditions that shape our people-places to ask together with historian-activist, Ariella Azoulay (2019), how are we making ‘traditions of what <em>can</em> be’? (8)</p>



<p>Gaelic – language of and in our places – inspires us in this future-assembling of knowing <em>how to know</em> what sustains people and homes; our <em>oikos</em>. It connects our reflecting with these ‘Own’ ecologies to our deepening empathy with others seeking sustainability and justice throughout the world. This integrative empathy is held in the word <em>dùthchas</em> – a ‘unity existing between land, people, all living creatures, nature and culture’ (9). It expresses, as Alan Riach proposes, traditional prefiguring of our contemporary concerns for ecological balance. In this <em>oikos</em> balancing <em>with</em> and <em>for</em> all being – in local and world-facing lives – we place our <em>gathering</em> into the ‘carrying stream’, transmitting our hopes and intentions to ‘leave no-one behind’ (10).</p>



<p><strong>ENTANGLED LEGACIES<br></strong>The ‘uncanny hauntings’ of colonial legacies, in all their guises, should inform how we understand the various traditions and heritages within the Highlands and Islands, both historically and today. As researcher<strong> Lauren Pyott</strong> reminds us, the pioneering work of David Alston (2006, 2018) has uncovered the breadth and depth of Highland involvement in the Transatlantic Slave Trade, something which touched upon the lives of many in the region, whether directly or indirectly. (11)</p>



<p>Contemporary land ownership patterns are still rooted in historical injustices, tied both to the legacy of the Highland Clearances and, as recent research has confirmed, slavery-derived wealth was used 200 hundred years ago to enclose land into large estates (12). The landscape was then used to distract from the reality of this transformation through romantic narratives and a visual culture of sublime, people-less wilderness – an elite way of seeing that served the interests of landed power. Symbolic of this era is the iconic image of Landseer’s ‘<a href="https://www.nationalgalleries.org/art-and-artists/159116/monarch-glen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monarch of the Glen</a>’ (1851). Exploitative forms of tourism, Lauren argues, can serve a similar process, with the perpetuation of this way of seeing alongside the inexorable spread of holiday lets transforming the land and communities of the Highlands into a place where young people are unable to find or afford homes.</p>



<p>Many would argue that communities in the Highlands and Islands are reliant on tourism and the revenue it brings. The promotion of this region as a tourist destination does generate jobs and profits for some; at the same time, mass tourism – as an engine of economic growth – is complicit with global capitalism’s depthless markets and precarious labour, it commodifies cultures and is implicated in global climate breakdown through mass international travel. The impacts of over-tourism in fragile communities are stark. Writing from Achiltibuie in the Coigach peninsula, <strong>Lisa MacDonald </strong>asks,</p>



<p><strong>“Are we really so dependent on tourism that our own young families can’t find homes? The current rate of through-put feels industrial, even abusive. It creates hostility, not hospitality. The same is true in Skye, and I can see it happening all along the NC500: where folk used to be delighted that visitors wanted to come here, now it is simply too much, and we become irritable and unwelcoming. What are the ways in which we could reclaim the word ‘hospitality’? Can we find ways to use local resources more sustainably?”</strong></p>



<p>This is an increasing reality and one actively promoted by national and regional government agencies. The NC500 is an example of a marketised and marketising response to the Scottish Government’s espousal of tourism as the single most important strand for Highlands and Islands local enterprise. It was dreamt up in our fossil-fuelled growth paradigm as a way of exploiting the opportunity (and culture and natures) in much the same way as colonial, extractive industries have been in the past: maximise profit, exploit the resource, minimise input to sustain the resource (people and environment). It has subsumed primary industry in terms of infrastructural support, with money being given for visitor attractions and car parks. Moreover, there is a clear lack of investment in infrastructure that allows tourism to feed back into the local economy, as opposed to just profiting certain businesses.</p>

<p><strong>ALTERNATIVE FUTURES<br></strong>Ethnologist and writer <strong>Mairi McFadyen </strong>(13)<strong>,</strong> writing from Abriachan on the north side of Loch Ness, is a member of the Enough! Collective. In November 2020 she was a contributor to the online short course ‘Degrowing the Economy, Regrowing our Lives’ run by Enough! and the Centre for Human Ecology. The pursuit of growth, she writes, has suppressed and damaged many things that support the flourishing of life and its vital sustaining (see Macleod and also Hickel in LESS issue 1). Degrowth, in part, is about <em>regrowing</em> those lost capacities, within ourselves and in our communities.</p>



<p>As long as the fundamentals of our society rely on growth, the introduction of degrowth is very difficult – possible only in a ‘society of degrowth’ which we must <em>create ourselves </em>(14). Degrowth is not a monolithic alternative to the existing capitalist status-quo; rather, it encompasses ‘a matrix of alternatives’ which ‘opens up space for human creativity.’ Imagining and assembling a degrowth future, then, is an invitation to adventure into a <em>plurality of possibilities</em>. At the roots of a degrowth society, this matrix of alternatives might be made up of community land trusts, community gardens, woodlands and farms, community energy initiatives, cooperatives of all kinds, artists’ collectives, fair trade, food justice or food sovereignty groups, alternative currencies, not-for-profit community and social enterprises, systems of local exchange, tool libraries, seed libraries, repair cafés, voluntary arts groups, community heritage groups and climate or environmental action groups, among many other examples. The question is how to cultivate this degrowth potential, opening up opportunities and non-commodified spaces for individuals, groups and communities to connect, organise and create lasting change.</p>



<p>There are countless such initiatives seeking alternative ways of living and working in the Highlands and Islands today. In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, many mutual aid groups emerged in local communities, and the Black Lives Matter movement globally has opened up some spaces for dialogue about addressing racism and decolonisation across different spheres in the region. <strong>Philomena de Lima</strong>, professor of Applied Sociology and Rural Studies – also involved in organic cheese making at one time – reminds us that the Highlands and Islands has provided a home to households and groups – from the region and those&nbsp; who have arrived here by accident or design – who have practised degrowth principles for decades. Little is known or written about these threads that form the fabric of the region. A few notable examples, she suggests, include: the off-grid Scoraig community on the West coast; organic farming and crofting households connected through Working Worldwide on Organic Farms (WWOOF); food buying groups across the Highlands from Tain, Skye to the Islands which were set up in the early 1980s and who sourced their food from Green City, a workers’ cooperative based in Glasgow; from these groups emerged a demand for accessing food in the Highlands which led to Highland Wholefoods, a workers’ cooperative set up in 1989; Clown Jewels, an arts project in the 1980s and 1990s which emerged from various individuals moving to the Highlands from communes in Perthshire and elsewhere and those living in the Highlands; and Reforesting Scotland, established in 1991, now a membership organisation concerned with the ecological and social regeneration of Scotland.</p>



<p>There is also a rich and radical heritage of activism and resistance. The story of community land ownership is vital here, a story in which the rural Highlands and Islands – Assynt, Eigg, Gigha, Harris – led the way for the urban movement. We can also find inspiration from those communities who have long demonstrated ways of living sustainably, not in a nostalgic or romantic sense, but in the radical sense of recovering lost knowledge and experience.</p>



<p>Far from being peripheral, the Highlands and Islands have a vital role to play in imagining and assembling Scotland’s degrowth futures. In practice, degrowth is about seeking out the principles of reconnection, decolonisation and decentralisation to renew and strengthen local communities of place and interests. In the sections that follow, we highlight some diverse but confluent tributaries into this ‘carrying stream.’</p>



<p><strong>PEOPLE AND PLACES</strong><br>PhD researcher <strong>Jo Rodgers, </strong>based in Glengarry, is a co-organiser of ‘The Edge’ research theme at the University of the Highlands and Islands. (15) Through monthly seminars, blog articles and photography, this forum offers a rich, interdisciplinary space for exploring and creatively expressing the histories, contemporary experiences and potential futures of people living, working and researching in so-called ‘peripheries.’ Her own doctoral research explores the interplay between roots-seeking travel and heritage in the island of Tiree from the perspectives of both islanders and visitors. Jo is also a (voluntary) director of Glengarry Community Woodlands and the Development Officer at the Community Woodlands Association, which supports Scotland’s growing network of community woodland groups, many of whom are exploring communal and ecological practices rooted in degrowth principles.</p>



<p><strong>Mairi</strong> is also a voluntary director at The Shieling Project / <em>Pròiseact na h-Àirigh</em> in Glenstrathfarrar. (16) The &nbsp;tradition of ‘the shieling’ – the summer pastures where people used to graze cattle, living in huts or shelters on common land – is a motif and context here for place-based learning about crofting, horticulture, green building, food growing and cooking, renewable technologies, traditional skills, crafts and culture. The project is in part inspired by the GalGael trust in Glasgow, a community organisation re-kindling community through <em>learning by doing. </em>(17) The Shieling too embodies degrowth principles; it’s about living in right relationship with the land, exploring the landscape’s past to help shape a more resilient future.<br></p>



<p><strong>Lisa MacDonald</strong> is a teacher, writer, singer and crofter in Achiltibuie. She is particularly interested in connections – between people and place, between past, present and future, between Gaelic language and heritage, between rights and responsibilities, and all across the integrated ecosystem that is this world. She writes,</p>



<p><br><strong>“For me, degrowth is about reclaiming self-sufficiency. There is so much land that we could grow things on, live on, raise children and hens and cows, but we can’t because it belongs to some landowner far away. The Green Bowl in Elphin have done a brilliant job of creating a&nbsp; crofters’ co-operative who grow things locally and then organise the picking up of supplies and the delivery of orders from meat and eggs to vegetables and baking. We shouldn’t need to rely on vast supermarkets shipping food from goodness-knows-where, at a huge environmental and social cost. Until we get to organising real land reform, we could all grow wee bits in our gardens and organise sharing. It gives us back confidence in ourselves and in the land – and in our place on it. It also connects us to each other within communities: I have hens, you bake &#8211; beautiful!&#8221;</strong></p>



<p>Food sovereignty is a vital part of degrowth. Earlier this year, the Highland Good Food Conversation took place online, bringing together farmers, crofters, growers, bakers, cooks and community groups. (18) The conference provided an opportunity for people to work together and come up with tangible actions that will contribute to achieving a more just, sustainable food system in the region. Accompanying the conference was a blog and series of podcasts, which explored themes such as regenerative farming, crofting, micro dairies, grain and bread production, aquaculture and the rise in community fridges.</p>



<p><strong>Raghnaid Sandilands – </strong>writer, independent publisher and Gaelic translator (19)<strong>–</strong> is involved with several creative community projects in Strathnairn on the south side of Loch Ness. <em>Lios na Feàrnaig</em> / Fearnag Growers is a community garden in Farr Estate, host to events, projects and art workshops. The garden’s most recent venture will see Col Gordon, a director of ‘Scotland the Bread’, (20) run a small heritage grain project, supporting the growing, harvesting and processing of old grain varieties <strong>– </strong>from seed to slice! Raghnaid is also involved with the local <em>Fèis </em>and with ‘Farr Conversations’ <strong>–</strong> a talk series set up in 2014 to ‘oil the wheels of engagement with issues affecting Scotland by hosting lively nights in one Highland hall.’ Farr Conversations has explored issues such as land reform and housing alongside music, songs and stories. For Raghnaid, this local activism is about inviting people to take agency in their own place, to ‘occupy the local hall’ and to be part of a story that is slowly accruing and unfolding. She describes this work as ‘cultural darning and mending’ <strong>– </strong>the act of finding disconnected threads from the past and weaving them back together with purpose. She writes,</p>



<p><strong>“Whatever diminishment of culture and landscape might have taken place, we can make imaginative connections that cut across time, to seek out knowledge and be part of a process that allows us, perhaps, to begin to create the circumstances necessary for transformation and change.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>Lauren Pyott </strong>is a researcher, cultural organiser and renters’ rights activist based in Inverness. Her previous research explored decoloniality and the politics of solidarity in the arts, and she is now involved in forming a Highland branch of the tenancy union Living Rent. (21) is also setting up a social enterprise in Inverness called Clachworks, which is working towards creating an open space for making and remaking, with a vision for a tool library, open-access workshop, and community garden. (22)</p>



<p><strong>“Degrowth and decoloniality are the two foundational elements that drove Clachworks from its inception and can only be properly understood in tandem. While the recent flourishing of ‘upcycling’ projects and growing interest in the circular economy are long overdue, Clachworks realises that this is nothing new. The crofting culture that once sustained human populations across the Highlands was necessarily circular, based on a synergetic relationship between the land, the lives inhabiting it and what they could produce.”</strong></p>



<p>The circular economy’s tenets of ‘make, remake, reuse’ were encoded in the very lifestyle and economic reality of subsistence farming in the region. The linear model of ‘take, make, use, discard’, which so successfully replaced it, should not only be seen as an environmental disaster, but also as a colonial act of what Mignolo (2007) terms ‘epistemicide’: the erasure of ways of thinking and being in the world. (23) Clachworks seeks to make critical connections between past and present, local and global, providing tools for making and remaking the world we live in.</p>



<p><strong>Kirsten Body</strong> is a visual arts producer also based in Inverness. She works for the Scottish Artists’ Union and is a founding member of the artist-led collective Circus Artspace, established in 2019. (24) Circus is committed to supporting graduate artists in the Highlands and to building a public programme around contemporary visual arts. In 2021, this will include new billboard commissions, an off-grid residency with Black Isle Permaculture and Arts and Inverness’ first Zine Festival. She writes,<br><br><strong>“Circus want our 2021 programme to track the shifting demographic of the Highlands and Islands and focus on the hidden, forgotten and unheard voices within our community. We want to diverge from Highland cliches and traditional notions of romanticism to reveal unexplored narratives and illustrate the interweaving, international cultures of our place. We want to amplify a wider diversity of voices, places and experiences and promote equality, with a particular focus on non-dominant narratives and communities.”</strong></p>



<p>Earlier this year, Circus collaborated with artist <strong>Fadzai Mwakutuya </strong>to host an informal online conversation called <em>Ubuntu // Daondachd // Humanity</em> about intersectional topics, including the experience of and reception to migrations <strong>–</strong> people leaving, returning and coming to the Highlands and Islands. Fadzai, from Zimbabwe and based in the off-grid community of Scoraig near Ullapool, is an artist who makes thought provoking socially engaged artwork under the name Afro Art Lab. (25) She is also a member of the Repository of the Undercommons (RotU), a curator/artist residency borne out of Enough! as a way to ‘(re)imagine alternatives, (re)create cultural codes, messages and values for our future(s).’ She writes,</p>



<p><strong>“In my art practice I use the concepts of degrowth and decolonisation abstractly in the choice of subject matter and materials whilst creating artwork. Degrowth has always been a way of life in developed countries in Africa; we do need to decolonise though, as Africans, and unlearn the ways of the west as we imagine them. I often remark on how this cycle of change is irrevocably enshrined in humanity, the constant conflict between perpetual efforts to campaign against narratives of power structures and encourage reform processes.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>Charlotte Mountford </strong>is also involved in socially engaged art practice. She is a cultural producer and programmer, a Mancunian who moved to the Highlands to become co-director of Lyth Arts Centre in Caithness (LAC). (26) She writes, “I love my role here, as it allows me to practice radical localism and challenge conceptions about what it means to be ‘rural’.” She reflects,<br><br></p>



<p><strong>“The conditions of COVID-19 provided an opportunity to really rethink how we work as an organisation. In a normal year, LAC would present hundreds of events from artists and creatives from all over the world. Reflecting, it is possible to see how extractive this is as a practice, particularly the world of international touring; how unsustainable it is for poorly paid artists and our environment. The pandemic has provided us with a blue-print for future working, notably in the development of new projects like CAIR: Caithness Artists in Residence. &#8216;<em>Cair</em> / <em>Cayr</em>&#8216; is a Scots word which means to return to a place where you have been before. I initially thought this meant <em>Déjà vu</em>, but then realised ‘cair’ doesn’t feel accidental – it is a deliberate return. Many of us thought we wanted to return to the normal we had before coronavirus, but I don&#8217;t. Where I actually want to return to is a place we have all been before; a place of home and of community.”</strong><br><br></p>



<p>CAIR embeds artists with distinct Caithness communities, exploring how LAC can work with artists and facilitate creative responses to local problems, encouraging creative cultural activism and prioritising an artist and community-centric approach to recovery after coronavirus. The artists are all based in Caithness, mostly in the communities they are working with. Instead of a one-off workshop by a visiting artist, the artists are working with their matched communities over the next 6 months, co-designing a bespoke programme of work that will explore local themes and issues:</p>



<p><br>“<strong>We can use artistic skills to capture perceptions and share them. As social practitioners, everything we do is inscribed in a place and time. What we are trying to do is not marketising placemaking but <em>place-being</em> and commonplacing; a creative assemblage representing the multi-faceted responses and encounters of a place .” </strong>(27)</p>



<p><strong>Ainslie Roddick</strong> moved from Glasgow to become director of ATLAS Arts in Portree (28) at the end of 2019. ATLAS organises collective art projects across Skye, Raasay and Lochalsh, and has a growing library of zines, seeds, equipment, and a studio for making and binding books. Building on a legacy of projects invested in local ecologies, their new team is beginning to imagine how the organisation will work and feel in the years ahead. Exploring ‘Plural Futures’ through conversation, meals and artist projects, the programme is taking shape through gatherings and bodies of work which centre complexity in belonging. The School of Plural Futures began in 2021, an alternative school led by folk aged 17-25 on Skye, exploring global climate justice as it relates to the lived reality and history of the locale, and the various outcomes and desires of the school will begin to inform ATLAS’ future work. As this evolves, reflecting on the <em>the gathering, </em>Ainslie writes,</p>



<p><br>“<strong>I am grateful to this gathering of critical friends in supporting a slowness that is not too slow, and for the succinct reminders of the mistakes, bad intentions, historical repetitions, and the power of stories.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cáit </strong>shares some final thoughts concerning how<em> the gathering</em> is a becoming of tradition; not just the traditions of what has been, but for what can be. The recognition that ‘community transmission’ enables the virus to grow has restricted our convivial opportunities for tacit carrying, including adapting those traditions, knowledges, and practices that are vital for resourcing people-places through the constant certainty of change – what <strong>Raghnaid</strong> has called our ‘cultural darning and mending’. The pandemic has restricted our spaces for sharing these ‘critical technologies’, including the affordance to collaborate in examining the narratives that shape us and, as <strong>Fadzai</strong> reminds us, to practice the reflexivity that ‘shifts’ our mindsets towards the futures we are making. While<em> the gathering</em> emerged as a particular environmental response, in a fragile environment being pushed to further precarity, it is also a creative, critical social action of transmitting the expressions of our ecological connectivity, an enacting of our intention to be a reflexive resource. In collectively considering and responding – as <strong>Ainslie</strong> says, being ‘slow but not too slow’ – we examine and embody practices of ‘carrying’, balancing unity between all being; making home – <em>oikos</em> – in collaboration with our local and world ecologies together.</p>



<p>We know, and we share, that this particular<em> and </em>connective ‘worlding’ requires inhabiting discomfort zones. Deepening reflexivity, undertaking Mignolo’s ‘epistemic disobedience’ (29) – degrowing and decolonising thinking and acting to enable new ways of knowledge – requires a commitment to engage in these discomforts, to <em>need</em> learning. This dynamic, relational anticipating, assembling and embodying is an inhabiting of specific lived experiences, and a reaching out in necessary connectivity.&nbsp; Gathering to share actions, examine contexts, and imagine more sustaining and just futures, is emerging to us as we experience it – stepping into the flow, finding our feet, being disturbed into shifting position, and, together, finding how to balance. This reflects the need-and-gift balancing of <em>dùthchas, </em>responding to the new particular needs of Highlands and Islands dwellers – including ourselves – in this time of pandemic, from the perspective of the ‘carrying stream.’</p>
