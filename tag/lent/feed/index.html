	<description>Enough! is an informal collective of activists in Scotland who have come together to take action on challenging our dominant economic system. We believe that inequality, oppression, injustice, power and ecological breakdown are all connected by the same story:</description>

<p>Following on from last year&#8217;s LESS for Lent, we are offering another participatory season of inquiry and practice into consumerism, desire, meaning and behaviour. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="539" height="232" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-from-2021-02-24-15-06-55.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8933" srcset="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-from-2021-02-24-15-06-55.png 539w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-from-2021-02-24-15-06-55-300x129.png 300w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-from-2021-02-24-15-06-55-100x43.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 539px) 100vw, 539px" /></figure>



<p>We might be feeling a bit bereft right now. Fragile. Looking for meaning and connection. It could seem that a fast is the last thing we need at the moment!&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lent&nbsp;</strong>is a traditional season of fasting and contemplation where it is customary to give up luxuries. For this reason, it&#8217;s a favourable time to take stock of what we value. Bruised and exhausted by a long lockdown- a necessary act of collective care- we are offered promises of consolation by buying our way back to happiness, and one day getting back to business as usual. But what if you can never have enough of what you never really wanted? Could the context of Lent help us to find ways to satisfy our fundamental human needs in different ways?</p>



<p><strong>LESS for Lent&nbsp;</strong>is a season of practices and provocations to explore together new/old ways of building sanctuary, challenge the ideology of perpetual growth, and find ways to live and to be that break free of exploitation, accumulation and extraction.</p>



<p><strong>LESS for Lent</strong>&nbsp;is an online and offline collective season including reflection, group work, transformation practices, movement and fasting from the destructive products of consumerism. It is an initiative of the Enough Collective&#8217;s Degrowth Commission.</p>



<p>You are invited to take part.&nbsp;<strong>LESS for Lent&nbsp;</strong>is for everyone regardless of faith or belief who has a willingness to participate.&nbsp;Lent traditionally falls in the season of the year known as the ‘the hungry gap’ where, historically, food and resources were difficult to come by. It is connected to cosmic cycles and ancient astronomical observations which connect us to the universe, as Easter always occurs on the first Sunday after the Paschal Full Moon (the first full moon that occurs after the vernal equinox). The English word ‘Lent’ comes from the Old English word&nbsp;<em>lencten</em>, meaning ‘spring season.’ Spring is a time of new energy, shift, renewal and transformation.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>HOW DO WE TAKE PART?</strong></h4>



<p>There are four pillars of LESS for Lent, which have been designed to take into account the lockdown context: For the period from Ash Wednesday, 17th February to the 3rd of April just before Easter:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Abstain from&nbsp;non-essential purchases</strong></li><li><strong>Fast from non-essential use of digital devices</strong></li><li><strong>Read, learn, share, discuss and build alternatives together</strong></li><li><strong>Take sanctuary: commit to practices that ground, connect and root</strong></li></ul>



<p>Your interpretation of this will be personal and individual, but we will be sharing weekly readings and resources to guide and inform your practice.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>COMMUNITY AND SHARING</strong></p>



<p>During LESS for Lent, participants will be given access to an online forum to share, discuss and support each other. This is also where the weekly readings will be shared. Additionally, there are seven online sessions which participants are encouraged to take part in (schedule subject to change:)</p>



<p><strong>Fri 19th Feb 1800-2000</strong>&nbsp;Introduction to LESS for Lent, overview and Q and A&nbsp;<br><strong>Wed 24th Feb 1800-2000</strong>&nbsp;Community Gathering (getting to know each other and forming interest groups)<br><strong>Wed 3rd Mar 1800-2000&nbsp;</strong>How to be a Local: Belonging, Meaning, and Knowing Life and Nature at Home<br><strong>Wed 10th Mar 1800-2000</strong>&nbsp;Sharing with special guest Alastair McIntosh&nbsp;<br><strong>Wed 17th Mar 1800-2000</strong>&nbsp;Technology, Distraction and Stimulation: Switching Off<br><strong>Wed 24th Mar 1800-2000&nbsp;</strong>Movement and Embodiment Practice session&nbsp;<br><strong>Wed 31st Mar 1800-2000</strong>&nbsp;Concluding rites and optional Easter planning</p>

With LESS for LENT we&#8217;re inviting people on a journey with us to explore why this is happening, uncover the true costs of our current way of life, and discover that Together, We Are Enough&#8221;</p><cite>Luke Devlin</cite></blockquote>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><strong>Capitalism is based on the belief that the best way to organise the economy is by giving us what we want, all of the time.&nbsp; We are addicted to capitalism because we are blinded by the illusion that we can satiate our desires by consuming more. </strong></p>



<p>The thing is, <strong>more will never be enough. </strong></p>



<p>The capitalist free market is driven by producers competing with each other to meet the never-ending desires of its consumers. This relentless desire is not a natural human impulse: demand is manufactured by making us feel a sense of lack. We are trapped by&nbsp;an incomplete satisfaction that relentlessly compels us after more, the new, the better &#8211;&nbsp;&nbsp;sold to us via mass advertising and a relentless daily transmission of algorithmically-driven distractions, attractions and personally-tailored ads ‘just for you.’</p>



<p><strong>We must break this addiction.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Capitalism and endless growth creates vast inequalities, props up authoritarian regimes across the globe and &#8211; through the processes of exploitation, accumulation and extraction &#8211; is the direct cause of ecological breakdown and climate crisis.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What if there is a different way of thinking about and acting on your desires and impulses?</strong> </p>



<p>What if there was a way of living that resisted the ability of the capitalist system to manipulate your behaviour and decisions, that made you feel more free, more connected to what really matters? What if there was a different path that you could journey on, with other people that feel the same, to build life ways that can help our mutual survival, and help us to resist the myth of perpetual growth?</p>



<p><strong>#LESSforLENT</strong> <strong>invites us to divest ourselves of our addiction to capitalist consumerism, help us rediscover enjoyment as we actually experience it and ask,&nbsp; what really sustains?</strong> <strong>What really matters?</strong></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Is Less for Lent Religious?</strong></h4>



<p>Enough&#8217;s <strong>#LESSforLENT</strong> is not conceived of as a religious act, but neither is it wholly secular. While Lent is understood as a Christian period of reflection where it is customary to give up luxuries, the roots of Lent reach far back in time. Lent traditionally falls in the season of the year known as the &#8216;the hungry gap&#8217; where, historically, food and resources were difficult to come by. The English word &#8216;Lent&#8217; comes from the Old English word <em>lencten</em>, meaning &#8216;spring season.&#8217; Spring is a time of new energy, shift, renewal and transformation.</p>



<p>LESS, in this context, can be understood to stand for <strong>LESS ENERGY, STUFF and STIMULATION</strong>. Consciously and intentionally decreasing our consumption helps us to reduce our reliance on unsustainable and unjust systems and increases our ability to participate in alternatives to capitalism.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How Do We Take Part?</strong></h4>



<p><strong>You are welcome to engage with #LESSforLENT however you wish, on your own terms.</strong></p>



<p>Lent this year begins on <strong>Wednesday 26th February</strong> and ends at Easter.&nbsp;We invite you to take concrete actions together for 40 days:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Abstain from non-essential material purchases</strong></li><li><strong>Fast from non-essential use of digital devices, or a full digital detox</strong></li><li><strong>Take up a regular creative practice</strong></li><li><strong>Read, learn, explore, discuss and build alternatives together</strong></li></ul>



<p></p>



<p>We<strong> </strong>also invite you to start your own weekly group meeting (online or in-person) for discussion of readings and taking part in transformative practices, and suggest culminating  in a communal shared celebration feast on Easter Sunday, 12th April 2020.</p>



<p><strong>If you would like to receive weekly updates on the material, additional accompaniment, and (optionally) be put in touch with others in your area to form an in-person group, you can sign up for free here</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>We recognise the predicament of using social media and technology to promote our critique of it: this is an example of how, as consumers, we are all complicit in and benefit from the system. </strong>The fact is, corporate social media has become one of the main ways people communicate with each other &#8211; and we need to be in that conversation to have an impact. </p>
