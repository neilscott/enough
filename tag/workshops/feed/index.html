<p><strong>4<sup>th</sup> November, 10am – 12pm, Macleod Hall, The Pearce Institute</strong></p>



<p>Free but bookable event. <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/degrowth-not-green-growth-economics-as-if-life-matters-tickets-200118779657" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eventbrite link</a></p>



<p><em>Presented by the Centre for Human Ecology and <a href="https://www.enough.scot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Enou</a></em><a href="https://www.enough.scot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>gh! Scotland</em></a></p>



<p>There is much talk about ‘Green Economy’ or ‘Green Growth’ as the main solution to climate change. In this teach-in we will examine the fundamental problems of the narratives of Green Growth, how it is preserving a status quo that will further accelerate climate breakdown. In the second part, we’ll take a look at Degrowth as an alternative for a just and social transformation of our society.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Care as Commons: Feminist and Postcolonial Economics<br></strong><em>Degrowth in Practice I</em></h2>



<p><strong>8<sup>th</sup> November, 10am – 12pm, Macleod Hall, The Pearce Institute</strong></p>



<p><strong>Free but bookable event.<a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/energy-transitions-climate-justice-and-human-needs-tickets-200367784437" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Eventbrite link</a></strong></p>



<p>Degrowth, while a general critique of our global state of affairs, is fundamentally a situated approach and makes sense for the Global South as an anti-colonial project. Green Growth is pushed as a new language of imperialism in places like Chile and in “energy transitions” initiatives. This teach-in highlights the resistance to the “growth at all costs” that emerges from communities defending their territories and different cosmologies and frames degrowth as a project of global solidarity and human needs.</p>
