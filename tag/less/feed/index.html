<p><em>Forms of traditional ecological knowledge that have been erected since antiquity in Scotland are ripe for re-imagining. Col Gordon explores ways in which a renewed application of these methods can help transition to sustainable, locally-appropriate forms of agriculture in the post fossil-fuel era.</em></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“I hear the storm. They talk to me about progress, about ‘achievements’; diseases cured, improved standards of living. I am talking about societies drained of their essence, cultures trampled underfoot, institutions undermined, lands confiscated, religions smashed, magnificent artistic creations destroyed, extraordinary possibilities wiped out.” – Aimé Césaire, <em>Discourse on Colonialism</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Ever since hearing it a few years ago, I’ve been haunted by what I take to be a very important statistic. Whilst making up just 5% of the world’s population, Indigenous peoples protect and steward 80% of global biodiversity. Indigenous peoples have generally managed to co-exist in relative balance with the environments they inhabit, and which they, more often than not, see themselves as a part of. For those of us who are not among this 5%, this statistic forces us to ask if there’s a need to learn, or indeed relearn, how to live with the rest of the more-than-human world in ways that resemble how Indigenous peoples do.</p>



<p>The question that has been preoccupying me over the past couple years is what could this mean here, in Scotland, or more specifically in the Highlands and Islands – the Gàidhealtachd? I’ll situate this consideration in and amongst the hotly debated, current, and divisive issue of rewilding and how it could relate to both repeopling and cultural revival.</p>



<p>But to start, I’ll begin with a plant: <em>Avena Strigosa</em> or Corc Beag – the small, bristle, grey oat. These oats, along with Bere Barley and Hebridean Rye, are the last remaining cereal landraces to be found in Scotland. A landrace can be defined as a “locally adapted variety of a domesticated species of plant (or animal) which over time has become well adapted to its local environmental conditions” (SASA, n.d.).<em> </em>Cultivated year in, year out for hundreds if not thousands of years, they exist today only in the Northern and Western Isles, areas which conventional wisdom might define as peripheral. Grown as fodder for livestock, the 540 hectares of Corc Beag grown annually on the Uists make up the largest area of surviving landraces anywhere in Britain (BSBI, 2010). In many ways it’s a miracle that they still exist at all.</p>



<p>Yet these were once the major food crops of the Gàidhealtachd. If you read the accounts from early travellers to the region, it becomes apparent quite how much grain was grown here in the past. When Martin Martin (1697) visited in 1695, grains seem to have been cultivated almost everywhere, often on places where today it would be very hard to believe it possible. In giving an account of Skye for the Board of Agriculture in 1811, James MacDonald reported that of the island’s total landmass of roughly 350,000 acres, 8.5% was used as arable land. MacDonald (1811: 209, 761) claims of Corc Beag that “this grain constitutes the bread of three-fourths of the population”, and, despite the population then being almost double what it is today, that the soils of Skye should be capable of being able to “supply their present population with bread.”</p>



<p>The volume of grain being produced was only possible because this arable system worked in tandem with another agricultural practice: the Shieling system. At its most basic, the Shieling system was a form of what is called transhumance – where people and livestock would move away, beyond the boundary, from the fertile low-lying glens or in-byes, and into the out-bye land or fàsachs, and up into the hills or onto the moors where they would spend long summer months living in the àirighs or shielings, herding and milking their livestock.</p>



<p>This was an agricultural system that in many ways also held much of Gaelic lifeway patterns and cultural norms together. By and large, the Gaelic calendar year was split into two halves: the season of growth that began with the celebrations of Beltane in early May; and the season of decay that was marked by Samhain at the end of October and was also understood to be the beginning of the Gaelic new year. These calendar dates where the markers for when the transhumance could begin and end, and both dates involved elaborate festivities and rituals. The significance of this seasonal movement to Gaelic culture was enormous, as attested to by the volume of songs and stories in the archives about the shielings and summer milking.</p>



<p>As well as providing the dairy products which, along with grain, made up the bulk of the traditional Gàidhealtachd diet, there is evidence that the Shieling system was beneficial to the land. When the early travellers reported on what they found they were often describing open-park like woodland habitats, heathland, and moorland. Numerous ecologists have commented that the impacts of cattle and other livestock, if done in the appropriate way and stocked at the right density, can be beneficial to woodland ecology and biodiversity.</p>



<p>According to Frank Fraser Darling (1956), possibly the foremost 20th century ecologist of the Highlands and Islands, “The cattle husbandry and persistence of the forests were reasonably compatible and even complementary, for the cattle received shelter from the forest and the trees benefited from light cropping of the herbage floor, from the browsing and the manuring.” Writing about traditional cattle in woodland ecology in the Highlands, conservationist Roy Dennis (1998: 7-8) observes, “There is increasing interest in understanding the effects of mega-herbivores on forest ecosystems in Europe and a growing scepticism that the primeval forests were dark woodlands of densely growing trees. Instead, it is believed that fire and the large herbivores created mosaics on both large and small scales, and that in some places there were open ‘savannah-like’ wooded grasslands. … Without cattle, our forest ecosystems will not be as successful for biodiversity conservation.”</p>



<p>Echoing this point, Knepp Estate (n.d.) in the South of England, one of the primary working examples of the so-called rewilding movement, affirms that “the battle between these two opposing forces of nature – animal disturbance and vegetation succession – generates habitat complexity and biodiversity. Reintroducing some of these animals to the landscape – using domestic descendants as proxies for some of the extinct species – can have a hugely positive impact on nature.” This was to a certain extent the type of habitat that the early travellers to the Gàidhealtachd were describing: mosaics of savannah like wood pasture at various stages of succession, achieved in ways that were still healthy and dynamic. By moving the livestock into the hills and grazing in a way that was, at least in part, beneficial to the ecology of the habitat, there was an elegant, well-balanced system which made full use of the agricultural territory.</p>



<p>The territories were places that people knew intimately, as evidenced by the plethora of place names found within the Gaelic heartlands. Almost every rock and little pool or stream would appear to have had a name. But, significantly, the people here also knew how to <em>use</em> the territory in ways that are hard to envisage today.</p>



<p>The naturalist Thomas Pennant (1774) famously visited the Hebrides in 1772 to report to his readers on what he had seen. To accompany him, Pennant had brought along the botanist Rev. John Lightfoot who compiled a 1,200 page botanical survey later published in 1777. Whilst this record is mostly made up of scientific descriptions of his findings, he also included many ethnobotanical notes on how these plants were used. I still need to give the book more attention, but having gone through it I’ve found that Lightfoot noted uses for an astonishing 274 wild plants, including 92 food and drink plants, 41 dye plants, 94 medicinal plants, and 39 for fibres, building, or tanning. To me, this shows that as recent as the late-18<sup>th</sup> century, people here understood how to dwell within their territories in ways that resemble how many Indigenous peoples today relate to theirs.</p>



<p>Anthropologist Tim Ingold (2000: 147, 55) writes, “to live in the world is also to inhabit it. … Knowledge of the world is gained by moving about it, exploring it, attending to it, ever alert to the signs by which it is revealed. Learning to see, then, is a matter not of acquiring schemata for mentally constructing the environment but of acquiring the skills for direct perceptual engagement with its constituents, human and non-human, animate and inanimate.”</p>



<p>Up until last century, a very important word in the Gaelic worldview was <em>Tuath</em>. This word meant both “territory” and “the people of the territory”. The two were understood to be one and the same and inseparable. It’s my understanding that from this utterly interlinked belonging to territory you get other critical ideas in the cosmology such as <em>dùthchas</em> – an idea of belonging that is described by crofter and textile artist Alice Starmore as when “you belong to the land and the land belongs to you” (Farmerama Radio, 2021).</p>



<p>In <em>Tending the Wild: Native American knowledge and the Management of California’s Natural Resources</em>, M. Kat Anderson documents many of the different methods that the Indigenous peoples of California have used to manipulate the “wild” plants and terrains in order to promote the growth of species that were more culturally useful. In it she demonstrates that much of what would have been considered wilderness when first encountered by Europeans was in fact vast territories of carefully tended habitat that had been shaped by thousands of years of native burning, harvesting, tilling, pruning, transplanting, sowing, and scattering. The methods described don’t comfortably fit into either of the binary categories of hunter-gathering or agriculture but, rather, are better described as <em>tending</em>.</p>



<p>“Tend means ‘to have the care of; watch over; look after.’ Thus the word connotes a relationship of stewardship, involvement, and caring very different from the dualistic, exploit-it-or-leave-it-alone relationship with nature still characteristic of Western society. The role of nature’s steward was (and still is) one shared by many indigenous peoples” (Anderson, 2013: 358).</p>



<p>“The foundation of native people’s management of plants and animals was a collective storehouse of knowledge about the natural world, acquired over hundreds of years through direct experience and contact with the environment. The rich knowledge of how nature works and how to judiciously harvest and steward its plants and animals without destroying them was hard earned; it was the product of keen observation, patience, experimentation, and long-term relationships with plants and animals. It was a knowledge built on a history, gained through many generations of learning passed down by elders about practical as well as spiritual practices. This knowledge today is commonly called ‘traditional ecological knowledge’” (Anderson, 2013: 4).</p>



<p>In Gaelic this “traditional ecological knowledge” may be able to be translated as <em>dualchas</em>. Anderson continues, “one learns that Indigenous people achieve deeper intimacy with nature by using it. The character of each tree takes on new dimensions when transformed by human hands through scraping, skinning, soaking, peeling, boiling, mashing, grinding, fire hardening, splitting and decorating. … Each time a person transforms a plant, animal or mineral into a useful item it is an acknowledgement that he or she belongs to a place. … By using nature, we begin to know our place in it”<em> </em>(Anderson, 2013: 338, 363).</p>



<p>Could these ideas be encompassed in Gaelic by the word <em>dùthchas</em>? I believe it’s possible that they could.</p>



<p>***</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“The most important area of domination was the mental universe of the colonised, the control, through culture, of how people perceived themselves and their relationship to the world. Economic and political control can never be complete or effective without mental control. To control a people’s culture is to control their tools of self-determination in relationship to others.” – Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o, <em>Decolonising the Mind</em></p></blockquote>



<p><em>Shifting baseline syndrome</em> is a term used in ecology to express how reference points (baselines) for what is perceived as ‘natural’ change in populations over time. Our reference points for what is natural or normal in ecosystems and biodiversity have dramatically changed over the past centuries to the point where we may now perceive highly degraded landscapes as the ‘natural’ state of things – even if the breadth of habitats and richness of biodiversity we know today are just a fraction of what once was. Partially because of this, it can be hard to imagine what our landscapes could be like if they were healthy, vibrant, and fully functional.</p>



<p>This is equally as true with cultural diversity.</p>



<p>What we see today as ‘traditional’ are the leftovers that Gaels were allowed to keep after the land-based culture here was systematically eroded and indeed dismembered.</p>



<p>Arable crops are now only grown on the more fertile eastern parts of the Gàidhealtachd; the Shieling system has long since collapsed and transhumance no longer happens; there is little of the biodiversity that there once was and the traditional knowledge of wild plant use is all but gone.</p>



<p>When the Clearances began, the Shielings were some of the first things to be removed. This was also the time when folks started to be moved away from the old, communal settlements and townships and onto small individually allotted plots of land, called crofts. In processes which starkly paralleled those imposed on many Indigenous peoples all over the world, these crofts were never designed to be able to meet all the needs of subsistence and these new, forced land arrangements pushed the Tuath – the tenantry – into the wage economy in order to survive. Until the end of the 19th century, folks would refer to themselves as the Tuath, and it was only at a later stage that they began to identify as crofters, a term of Germanic origin brought into the region in the times of ‘improvement’ and clearance.</p>



<p>When the Shieling system was beginning to decline in the 17th century, it’s important to note that it was having to coexist with newer, export-oriented systems of droving and commercial forestry. And it is at this point that you start to see evidence of habitat loss due to pressures from overgrazing, and also the extinction of keystone mammals, such as beavers, wild boar, and wolves. The reintroduction of such species is of course a key bone of contention within the whole rewilding debate.</p>



<p>According to Iain MacKinnon (Farmerama Radio, 2021) in a contribution to <em>Landed</em>, an award-winning podcast series sharing the voices behind regenerative farming, “What there has been over the course of the last 300 or 400 years, but particularly the last 150 years, is cultural devastation for Gaelic Scotland. There’s comparatively little left, both in terms of social relations and cultural norms. … We’re living in the debris of our traditional society. We’re living in the wreckage. And we need to reconstitute something from that wreckage that doesn’t exclude or fence people out but supports people to come in and be part of that reconstituting process.”</p>



<p>In order to understand how to recover and reinvigorate some of these traditional land management practices, we need to look to what we know of the ruins from the past. According to sociologist Boaventura de Sousa Santos (2018), these ruins are also the seeds for imagining a hopeful future. The ruins and the wreckage of the past are where we may find some seeds that we can remember, rekindle, revitalise, and reinvent for today.</p>



<p>Some of these ruins may be actual seeds. The Corc beag, or grey oats, that once made up three quarters of the bread foods of the Gaels are no longer cultivated anywhere for human consumption. Indeed, because they’ve been neglected or forgotten for so long as a food, the plant itself is no longer viable as a foodstuff for humans. If I were to mill their grains, I would end up with nothing but dust and husk. Even the few experts who still work with these seeds now doubt that they could ever have been eaten by humans, despite the early accounts. But the seed still exists. To tend them as a foodstuff would involve patient restoration work over a number of decades.</p>



<p>Other ruins may be things like key Gaelic cosmological ideas: Dùthchas, or a sense of belonging to the land or the territory and an interconnection with every part of life within it; Tuath, where the territory and the people of the territory are one and the same; and Dualchas, the transfer of ancestral wisdom of how to live in balance within this territory, within this place.</p>



<p>These are things that were actively dismembered, and then forgotten. But today we are at a point where perhaps it’s time to re-member and repair them. These are keystone concepts for reconstituting the Gàidhealtachd, but they are also <em>just</em> ideas if they can’t be supported by and in turn support real-life practices. The erosion of the ecology and habitats, traditional land practices, lifeways and foodways has gone hand in hand with the erosion of the Gaelic language and its ways of being. The language, the lifeways, and the ways of being on the land are like legs on a stool that hold up a people and a culture. If one falls, they all start to collapse.</p>



<p>What would a decolonised Gaelic landscape look like today? How can we work towards that now? We are living in a time where, one way or another, things are not going to stay the same. Changes in how we go about using the land are inevitable. Today, and certainly tomorrow, there are going to be more and more calls for rewilding and for crofters to change their land practices in response to the various ecological and climate crises.</p>



<p>Is now the time to start to recover some of these lost practices; these ruins of our past? By attempting to revive, repurpose, and reinvent some of these old lifeways, foodways, and ways of interacting with and using the land, we may be able to actively support some of these key Gaelic ideas and cultural practices and by doing so play a role in the reconstitution process Iain Mackinnon mentioned.</p>



<p>In <em>Indigenous Food Sovereignty in the United States,</em> editors Elizabeth Hoover and Devon A. Mihesuah (2019) write, “The concept of Indigenous food sovereignty is not focused only on right to land, food and the ability to control production systems, but also responsibilities to and culturally, ecologically, and spiritually appropriate relationships with elements of those systems. This concept entails emphasizing reciprocal relationships with aspects of the landscape and the entities on it.”</p>



<p>Rewilding is now here and – like it or not – it’s probably here to stay. Yet there is no implicit, fundamental contradiction or even tension between the actual science of rewilding and these traditional ways of being. To me, what we have is an opportunity to present a case for a return to something which could resemble an ‘indigenous’, pre-clearance approach to dwelling in the land.</p>



<p>If there’s money going into purchasing large areas of land to rewild, then we need to ask: what does rewilding look like? Crofting and rewilding are often pitted against each other in a narrative that suggests they are incompatible. But rather than opposing rewilding on the grounds that it is not compatible with the practices that were imposed on the Gàidhealtachd through colonial mechanisms, we should instead start to advocate for embedding these pre-clearance practices into the rewilding agenda and demanding that they are included, considered, and acted upon by people.</p>



<p>It is the very same people who destroyed the Indigenous cultures and land practices who are now calling for a return to the landscape they destroyed. But “Is treasa tuath na tighearna” (The people are mightier than a lord). We need to become the Tuath once more and demand that if this happens it does so in conjunction with a return to ‘indigenous’ land uses, in a relevant and reinvigorated way for today. These ideas need to be invoked now and attempts at living them need to be made. Over the centuries Gaels were domesticated into the state and maybe now is the time for the Tuath to be rewilded.</p>



<p>If folks want to buy up the land to rewild it and that genuinely is their purpose, fine. Buy it up but then give it back to the Tuath to carry this process out. This is a moment and an opportunity to try to remember and invoke these ruin seeds. To move them towards being living seeds once again.</p>

<p><em><strong>Degrowth and Ecology: a Silent Planting</strong></em></p>



<p><em>Last night we launched our new issue with the magnificent <a href="https://thestove.org/the-stove-cafe/]" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stove Network </a>in Dumfries. You can pick up a copy from there, and in the coming weeks across Scotland- check the list of our <a href="https://www.enough.scot/less-distribution-hubs/">Hubs here</a> for updates, or order a bundle to help share and distribute by contacting <a href="https://www.enough.scot/less/">us here.</a></em></p>



<p>In this issue, we wanted to explore the ecological issues we face beyond the crisis of carbon. We wanted to look at the problems of biodiversity and habitat loss, species-collapse, extinction, pollution of seas and lochs and air and soil that stem from our economic system and our cycles of endless production and consumption. This issue of LESS looks at omnicide in Scotland, its history and trajectory, its drivers and its resisters.</p>



<p>At the same time, we explore how processes of degrowth and decolonisation could decontaminate this process and work towards restoration and reinhabitation. Since the first issue of LESS was published, degrowth has developed from a relatively unknown and frequently misunderstood concept into an influential part of many conversations around how we navigate from the current metacrisis to new possibilities of human flourishing.</p>



<p>In Scotland, degrowth has taken root in a modest but meaningful way. It’s been remixed, regenerated, and made local by a network of activists, artists, researchers, and communities. This has taken place alongside a flowering of related scholarship, research, and publications internationally. What is emerging is a new synthesis between critically-engaged scholarship and applied practice in which its principles are embodied. The contributors to this issue are, as in previous issues, a mixture of practitioners and activists, scholars and thinkers.</p>



<p>As we describe elsewhere, creating degrowth cultures and changing the narrative about how ‘wealth’ is created and what a ‘true prosperity’ would look like is the challenge ahead. This is a major task in a society deep in climate denial and suffering the collective trauma of Covid. But is it a challenge that comes in the wake of seismic climate failure and the UK emerging as a sort of ‘failed state’, a kleptocracy of elite rule. ‘True prosperity’ may seem an elusive and difficult aim but in the context of mass immiseration and climate failure the ruinous <em>status quo</em> is indefensible.</p>



<p>This issue of LESS explores broadly how degrowth intersects with Scotland’s ecologies: social, human, and beyond. The words <em>ecology</em> and <em>economy</em> derive from the same ancient Greek root, <em>oikos, </em>meaning the good stewardship of a family’s home. The violent, dualistic rupture of this term into two concepts set in oppositional relation to each other needs to be healed and integrated. What does this mean for us in our time and place?</p>



<p>The answers to this constitute a plurality of possibilities that unfold in unexpected ways. We have stories to draw on that hint at a richer, more complex set of relations with the worlds beyond human supremacy, a complexity explored in Hanna Tuuliki’s work. As Dougie Strang notes in his interview with the artist, with a nod to a phrase coined by philosopher and ecologist David Abram in his book <em>The Spell of the Sensuous</em> (1996): “Tuulikki’s latest project, <em>Seals’kin</em>, plays again with the notion of entanglement between the human and the more-than-human.” More-than-human because animals should not be defined as simply non-human.</p>



<p>Iain MacKinnon uncovers mythopoetic elements in the cultural heritage of the Gàidhealtachd that can resource a return to a balanced ‘truth of nature’ in the face of ontological elimination. Mutually so, Col Gordon explores forms of traditional ecological knowledge and agricultural practice that can constitute distinctive lifeways in Scottish bioregions.</p>



<p>Bringing degrowth into conversation with <em>Buen Vivir</em>, an indigenous principle and decolonial practice of ‘Good Living’ from Latin America, Katherina Richter explores the need for a metaphysics adequate to address the metacrisis: “We can see that changes to our consumption, production, and working patterns alone won’t be enough to sustain a profound transformation towards a just and sustainable world. To understand the deeper shifts that are required, we need to look at cultural aspects of socio-ecological transformations. So what would it mean to put a cosmological limit to growth?”</p>



<p>Eric Swanepoel explores similar themes with the notion of the ‘real-growth’ of <em>Biospherism</em> which he describes through the illustrative mnemonic letters of C-LIFE – C: Circular Economy, the Commons, Community, Co-operation, Collaboration, Competition; L: Land, Language, Littleness, Localism, Long-Termism; Interdependence (Independence, Individualism); F: Food, Food Sovereignty, Framing (and values), Fungi; Economy and Ecology.</p>



<p>Nowhere are the ideas of perpetual growth more embedded and more destructive than in our food economy, in which the only metric for ‘success’ is endless growth, export sales, and a ‘productivity’ without recourse to any meaningful sense of quality. The alternative to this is explored by Diana Garduño Jiménez and Abi Mordin who describe their “quiet farming revolution” starting in South West Scotland in which farmers across the region have formed a network to exchange knowledge, experience, and practice in the journey to a “regenerative farming”.</p>



<p>In their focus on mining in Galloway, Annie Morgan and Nayab Khalid look from the particular to the global to talk of Martin Arboleda’s “planetary mine”. This thread is a recurring one of rooting action in place and time, but drawing back to see a wider and deeper picture. For Morgan and Khalid, Arboleda’s “concept of ‘global colony’ with interconnected infrastructures and technologies that transverse the entire globe &#8230; highlights the importance of understanding and challenging the extractivist model as a whole”.<br></p>



<p>As well as these fragments of other worlds and alternative paths we also offer to you our poster-graphic, our map of Scotland’s top twenty worst polluters, brought to you in collaboration with <em>The Ferret</em>, Scotland&#8217;s award winning investigative journalism cooperative. Finally, Steve Rushton reviews the recently published <em>The Future of Degrowth: A guide to a world beyond capitalism</em> by Matthias Schmelzer, Andrea Vetter, and Aaron Vansintjan, in which he argues that “Scotland needs to rectify and re-imagine its relations with the countries of the Global South, blazing a trail towards a post-colonial future.”</p>



<p>In offering this snapshot of the Scottish bioregion and its cultures, practices, and possibilities, we do not seek to claim any kind of moral or nationalist exceptionalism. Rather, we argue for guarding against the flattening monoculture of globalised capitalism and its destructive impacts. This means being open to the world and to the possibilities of taking our place as an independent nation, to become a radical ludic space – what Pat Kane has described as a potential ark and laboratory in an age of global meltdown.</p>



<p>However, we are conscious of the risks involved in asserting ‘indigeneity’ in a contemporary Scottish context. Certainly, elements of the lifeways, cultures, and patterns of colonisation and clearance of the Gàidhealtachd in particular have a strong case for such a claim – and are mutually recognised as such by some Indigenous peoples internationally. However, in the context of rising ethnonationalism and the ongoing reckoning with Scotland’s active role in Empire, slavery, and colonisation, it is imperative to both stand in explicit solidarity with colonised Indigenous peoples and their ongoing resistance, and carefully differentiate the distinctions and commonalities with care. Indigenous scholars place emphasis on ‘good relations’ with regard to using knowledge or truth claims that are based in particular places and peoples. This can be sensitive when importing place-based knowledge from Indigenous nations without addressing specific Indigenous societies whose homelands are occupied – see e.g. Vanessa Watts’ ‘Indigenous place-thought’. As Métis/otipemisiw scholar Zoe Todd puts it, “we cannot take Indigenous knowledge from one place and plop it into another context without doing violence to this knowing-being.” We commit – imperfectly – to active decolonisation and explore what this means in Scotland, while being careful not to mobilise concepts from specific areas of Indigenous thought in an extractive way.</p>



<p>Learning to ‘live in place’ will become a practical necessity as re-localisation and living within the natural carrying capacity of our bioregions becomes normal as climate breakdown intensifies. This might be the subversion we need of the storied Scottish cringe: could ‘knowing your place’ transmogrify from internalised shame and inadequacy – sent out into the world as colonisation and extractivism – into authentic place-based knowledge and belonging? Could ‘reinhabitation’ be the alter to imperialism? Could bioregionalism be the counter to colonialism?</p>



<p>In Scotland, the question of independence cannot be disconnected from an understanding of Scotland as a part of the web of life. As we go to press in unprecedented and terrifying heat across Europe, every day the world is alive with flashbang-warnings of ecological breakdown. These competing spaces, <em>Other Worlds</em> both collapsing and emerging, are in open collision, not just of values and structures but in time. Nowtopias and Dystopias existing in parallel in a world of deep-level precarity.</p>



<p>It seems too late, far too late.</p>



<p>But, in Richard Power’s 2018 novel, <em>The Overstory</em>, he collects a series of tales through the lens of the lives of trees. As Douglas Pavlicek plants Douglas Fir, for a company who he realises are the same company that are cutting them down, he writes:</p>



<p>“The smell of the cuts overwhelms him. Damp spice drawer. Dank wool. Rusty nails. Pickled peppers. Scents that return him to childhood. Aromas that inject him with inexp;icable happiness. Smells that plunge him down to the bottom of the deepest welland hold him there for hours. Then there’s the sound, like his rears are wadded up with a pillow. The snarl of saw and feller bunchers, somewhere in the distance. A great truth comes over him: Trees fall with spectacular crashes. But planting is silent and growth is invisible.”</p>

<p>Issue 4: the ecology issue.</p>



<p>With Glasgow&#8217;s COP26 fading into history as another milestone in industrial civilisations&#8217; failure to reckon seriously with the root causes of climate change, the limitations of our ability to handle diffuse, complex risk becomes clearer. Our national and global institutions, predicated on an anthropocentric worldview and quasi-fanatical adherence to the goal of economic growth is undermining the basis for life as we know it, and not just for humans.</p>



<p>Degrowth and its sister term decolonisation argue that the economy as presently constructed inevitably unleashes destruction of the natural world. This is the inevitable outcome of infinite growth in a finite material world. As we’ve said “Climate crisis is manifest destiny.”</p>



<p><strong>In this issue, we explore attacks on ecosystems, biodiversity loss, habitat destruction, resource depletion and scarcity in Scotland and beyond. How do our actions and consumption impact beyond our shores? What are the critical losses we have faced and will face right here?</strong></p>



<p>How has perpetual growth and consumption undermined eroded and destroyed: land and soil; air quality in our cities; water purity in our seas and lochs and rivers; and driven some species to extinction?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But as well as looking critically and honestly at the reality of ecological disaster in Scotland we will also look at restorative practices, regenerative practical projects and movements and examples of fresh thinking which addresses the realities we are facing. Forms of traditional ecological knowledge, biomimetics, practices and lifeways that de-centre human supremacy may give us clues to live well within limits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For this issue, we seek contributions on these and related themes. We are interested in non-fiction, reportage, field reports and case studies, poetry, illustrations and photography.</p>

<p><em>Mapping the emotional systems that could drive us to an ecological civilisation </em>by Pat Kane. This is from #2 of LESS our journal of degrowth, radical sufficiency and decolonisation in Scotland.  <a href="https://www.enough.scot/less/">Details of how to get a print copy here.</a><br><br></p>



<p>We hear a lot from behavioural science and nudge theory about how susceptible humans are to addictive and self-destructive behaviour &#8211; our inner “Homer Simpson”, short-termist, thrill-obsessed and anxious about status.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If this was the only account of evolved human nature going, then we’d be looking at our eternal vulnerability to consumerism and advertising, with all the dire consequences for material throughput this implies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what if there are a range of contending frameworks of human emotion and cognition &#8211; ones which emphasis the active power of imagination; or expand the repertoire of (and the interaction between) triggerable and visceral drives; or point towards ways whereby we can increase our non-reactivity, mindfulness and need for meaning?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Maybe we’re more like Lisa Simpson than Homer? And maybe this can also provide a neurophysiological basis for constructing a robust and lasting post-consumerist identity?</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>“D’oh!” This is Homer Simpson’s famous response to yet another failure to put his rationality ahead of his appetites and anxieties. But it’s also the noise you hear behind so much of what has become known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“nudge theory”</a>, as it observes us poor simians bumping into the sharp edges of a challenging modern world that, somehow and mysteriously, we managed to create.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Officially known as “behavioural economics”, nudge theory is so-called because it aims to steer we bemused, still-paleolithic creatures around our own social and economic landscape, gently pushing us away from self-destructive behaviours that we can’t help perpetrating.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why can’t we help it? Because beneath our elaborate and intricate worlds of code, law, culture and institutions, say the nudgers, we are essentially hunter-gatherers, whose survival drives persist into the complex present, and lead us astray.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed, it’s worse than that: we have figured our, via advertising and marketing (whether commercial or political), how to lead ourselves astray. Some classic examples follow. We have an ancient appetite for sweet and sucrose-intense foodstuffs &#8211; so we can be easily led down the path to over-consumption of junk and processed foods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our attention flickered around our old savannah landscapes, looking for predators or enemies &#8211; so we can readily become entranced by screens and interaction designs, which consciously and deliberately game those instincts securing our constant attention.</p>



<p>To survive, we sort ourselves into in-groups and out-groups, and develop attachments to kin (whether biological or fictive) &#8211; so we moderns are all-too-susceptible to status wars, identity politics/marketing, and even tribalism by <a href="http://This Is Your Brain on Nationalism: The Biology of Us and Them’, Robert Sapolsky, Foreign Affairs, March/April 2019, https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2019-02-12/your-brain-nationalism">means of polarisation.</a></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>We have an “aversion to loss” more than we have an “attraction to gain”, rooted in our early hominid insecurities about storing and retaining resources. Yet at the same time we are also afflicted with “optimism bias”: we routinely overestimate our own chances of success, and the impact of our own skills and talents, in any challenging situation &#8211; again, a capacity we apparently developed as we adapted to our harsh environments.</p></blockquote>



<p>It’s amazing. How do these broken, misfiring creatures even make their way to the <a href="http://See this comprehensive list of “cognitive biases” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases" target="_blank">bus stop each morning?&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>Scepticism about the research basis of “nudge” thinking is justified. Many of its tests have been enacted on early twenties graduates and post-graduates on Western university campuses, who one could conceivably imagine to be more impulsive and individualistic in their actions than in <a href="http://Nudge theory is a poor substitute for hard science in matters of life or death”, Sonia Sodha, The Guardian, 26 April 2020," target="_blank">many other cultures.</a></p>



<p>Building a case for “liberal paternalism”, in the words of Sunstein and Thaler &#8211; where psychologically-informed politicians, managers and administrators “architect the choices” of these poor Homers, steering them away from “predictably irrational” self-harms — is easier if the human evidence for it is so specific (eg impatient, not fully mature young students).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the same means, of course, these creatures can also be steered towards self-harm. The perpetual offer of cut-price chocolates at the supermarket counter is an example of nudge thinking that aims to exploit our “cognitive biases”. It associates spending at the counter with a cash saving on a sugar high, <a href="http://Nudging at the checkout counter – A longitudinal study of the effect of a food repositioning nudge on healthy food choice”, L.C. Van Gestel et al. Psychology &amp; Health, Volume 33, 2018 - Issue 6, https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08870446.2017.1416116" target="_blank">wiring a retail behaviour in with our ancient susceptibility.</a></p>



<p>In terms of the urgency of climate crisis &#8211; where a consumerism that plays on and to these cognitive and physiological biases keeps material throughput constantly on the increase, as we’re triggered to keep impulse buying &#8211; the nudgers’ map of evolved (and limited) human nature would seem to bring us grim news.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If indeed we are these lost, stumbling, savannah-era creatures, stranded paleolithics endlessly susceptible to the sparkles and enticements of consumer society and political messaging, then all we can hope for is that our rulers and steerers &#8211; who possess this powerful map of human weakness &#8211; don’t jerk us around too much. And if/when they do, they do it in the right direction. Because we, the people, are poor forked Homer Simpsons, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/nudge-nudge-pat-kane-s-big-ideas-for-busy-readers-864477.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">waiting to be nudged towards the light.&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>***</p>



<p>But what if we were Lisa Simpson, as much as Homer? That is, what if we were expressive, constructive, artistic, idealistic, self-programming, ethically ambitious?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well, we know this to be the case &#8211; we know these people in our own lives, we can find them in the media if we look hard enough, and sometimes they achieve stellar status by virtue of their sheer integrity (Greta Thunberg’s moral intensity about the climate crisis the most recent example). Those of us who are progressive activists are inspired by such people, and hope to ignite their flame inside us, and in those we hope to mobilise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And in our urgency, most of us won’t be stopped from trying to summon up the better angels of our nature, by a crabbed, self-subverting mantra about the evolved inevitability of our species-mediocrity. Yet the human science of this probably does have to be grappled with, and countered, rather than just ignored. If only because it unnecessarily induces despair and fatalism about how much humans can transform <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23231002-200-playing-politics-exposing-the-flaws-of-nudge-thinking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their own understandings and motivations.</a></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>If we are creatures of cognitive <em>surplus</em>, as much as of cognitive limits, then it is possible that we might respond to (say) an appeal to build a complex “ecological civilisation” (<a href="http://www.yesmagazine.org/issue/ecological-civilization/2021/02/16/what-does-ecological-civilization-look-like/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to use Jeremy Lent’s term</a>). In such a civilisation, we are (at worst) masters of our evolved and visceral reactions to the world. And at best we are mindful self-shapers and systemic adepts, applying our ingenuity to the pursuit of a planet-friendly common life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>As far as my reading in the last 20 years can tell me, there is more than enough evidence in the human sciences to support our capacity for this kind of fully-awake, complex living. But we need to start arranging it all into a new map &#8211; one that can fully contend with the depressing overview of the nudgers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first point of intervention would be to widen the “dashboard” of primary emotions that are understood as triggering our most “predictably irrational” responses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the Scottish independence movement, the spectre of “Project Fear” &#8211; the name the No side gave to their scaremongering referendum campaign in 2012-2014 &#8211; contains one of the key “negative” emotions that can be seen to deeply drive human (and indeed mammalian) existence. Yet there are potential Projects also for both Anger and Panic/Sadness (this latter emotion rooted in anxiety around separation, aloneness and abandonment. Does that ring a bell?).&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is one end of the “primary emotions” dashboard as laid out by the late Jaak Panksepp, founder of what’s called “affective neuroscience” or AN (which distinguishes itself from cognitive neuroscience (CN) in its <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2018.01025/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emphasis on how our ancestral emotions deeply determine our consciousness</a>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>What is exciting about Panksepp and AN is that the dashboard extends towards other primary emotions &#8211; and these are as positive and generative as the others are negative and defensive. Panksepp titles them Care, Play and Seeking/Curiosity (he even fully CAPITALISES them, to emphasize their primacy in organisms, but I won’t follow that rule here).<br></p>



<p>It shouldn’t be hard to imagine how one might begin to orchestrate these three emotional systems in service of an ecological civilisation &#8211; particularly if we attend to Panksepp’s particular definitions. What’s also important to note is that AN believes these are “visceral” emotions &#8211; meaning that to the human experiencing them, they are near involuntary reactions: we are “pulled” towards them, and they contend powerfully within us. (To my mind, this is a different framing of emotion than that of the nudgers, who delight in how our noble and rational intentions are endlessly subverted by our evolved inheritance. Instead, these are emotions understood more operatically, as a profound and turbulent motivational landscape, the primal drama of our lives).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Care &#8211; essentially, maternal and paternal protection and development of offspring, community members, or any other entities requiring nurturance and support &#8211; seems obviously useful. Environmental discourse is powerful when it invokes Mother Earth or Gaia; and the concept of the Anthropocene implies a story in which we are responsible for the fate of the blue planet. To care for an entity is not to be transactional with it, or to have one’s emotions subverted by individualism or ego.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet we can amplify the power of Care with the power of Play, as an emotional system. Care provides the human organism with the experience of being at home in, being loved and esteemed by, the world. And Play stands upon the security Care generates, in order to healthily (and joyfully) experiment and test how we can be in that world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Far from being trivial or a diversion, in evolutionary terms Play is how social, symbolic, imaginative animals like us rehearse being with each other. It creates zones (and much of the arts can be subsumed in the Play system) in which realities are simulated, put together and taken apart, with the risks taken being merely discursive or creative, <a href="https://www.journalofplay.org/sites/www.journalofplay.org/files/pdf-articles/9-2-article-1-ethology.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not life-or-death.&nbsp;</a></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>When we understand how Play operates in the evolved human condition, we can break through the way that advertising (and digitality) hold promises of novelty and new worlds just out of reach of their consumers, in an endless and addictive fashion. Instead, if we try to access the creative and prototypical impulse at the heart of Play, and instil it with the empathy of Care, we end up with the young climate strikers and Extinction Rebellion’s most successful moments &#8211; turning streets into alternative communities of performance, discourse and bravery. Into “grounds of play”.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>Seeking/Curiosity is a deep emotional system for Panksepp, which goes way beyond the mammalian realm, and is essentially to do with the inner state of any organism, which needs to ascertain what its external environment is &#8211; whether sustaining or threatening &#8211; and moves around in the world to seek out that evidence. At the human level, philosophers like Spinoza called this “conatus” &#8211; understood as drive, will, motive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Seeking/Curiosity sits below and beyond Anger, Fear, Panic, Care or Play. It manifests as a desire than can’t requite itself, or the impulse to action rather than passivity in a situation. Such desire is clearly harnessable in many directions, and for many different “Projects”. (There is a seventh primary and visceral emotion in the Panksepp system, Lust, which shouldn’t go without saying &#8211; but perhaps needs another essay to integrate into our picture, as it can either integrate or unravel those in its grip).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The science of emotions, as explored by other figures like Antonio Damasio, often connect this desire to the need for “homeostasis” in organisms &#8211; a term you may know as referring to self-balancing and self-correction (like the homeostat regulating the heating in your house). Damasio prefers the term “homeodynamics”. This is the gentle flourishing which is the ideal state for a healthy organism &#8211; keeping enough energy resources in reserve, to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONByvKuMa4w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fuel a curiosity about your environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>When connected to Play, and particularly when it happens in the super-playful human animal, this Seeking/Curiosity is the drive behind the elaborate structures and rules of our civilisations. Of course, all of these emotional systems fuel the more self-conscious, cognitive and imaginative parts of our minds, which grow the cultures that are between us. We can imagine (and remember) civilisations that are (and were) founded on the visceral triggering of Fear, Anger and Panic/Sadness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet I am strongly suggesting that affective neuroscience should give activists the confidence to identify, and then to cultivate, the more “positive” and generative primary emotions. They can be deep motivators towards building an ecological civilisation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>A final caveat. The human sciences (and particularly the sciences of emotions) are a crowded, contested and constantly shifting field. A recent challenge to affective neuroscience’s map of evolved and deeply rooted emotions comes from the constructionist model, preeminently developed by the aforementioned <a href="https://lisafeldmanbarrett.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lisa Feldman Barrett.</a></p>



<p>It’s “constructionist” because Barrett and her peers believe that emotions are much more culturally constructed (and culturally relative) than they are a set of “essential” emotional modules. In a sardonic way, she charges essentialists as invoking “an inner beast that needed to be controlled by <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/the-secret-history-of-emotions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">divine, rational thought”.</a></p>



<p>Her own laboratory studies and literature reviews aim to refute the idea that we have a “fear” circuit or “play” circuit in the brain. For Feldman, the emotions are much more emergent between a human and their environment. They arising from the meeting of a flexible brain network that’s constantly anticipating our reality; and a culture/language that gives us more subtlety in handling emotions, the more culture we imbibe.</p>



<p>This means, as far as I understand her work, that our emotive, motivated selves are far more shapeable by a powerful story, metaphor or image (still or moving) that we have been previously prepared to accept. Yet if we understand this, claims Barrett, we can then take on the responsibility to re-story ourselves. And now aware that we have a much greater capacity to do this than we realised.</p>



<p>I find myself placed somewhere between the “essentialist” and the “constructionist” positions in this debate, these two camps of the neuroscience of emotions and cognition. I think it’s important that humans realise how homologous they are with other mammals, and even organisms beyond that. It feels like a biological connection, a shared fate, which might be transforming if dwelt upon deeply enough.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I also appreciate that we are also radically constructionist animals &#8211; with extraordinary capacities for self-reflection, conceptualisation, fabulation. We will need all those imaginative powers, rethinking not just technology but styles and ways of life, if we are to get out of the 2020s alive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At least, let’s say that there’s more to us, and our evolved resources, than Homer Economicus.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Hardly anybody has understood that the Covid-19 pandemic is not an isolated and exceptional event, but rather a single moment in a much broader process: ecosocial collapse.</em> By Adrián Almazán and Luis González Reyes, translated by Tom Younger. <br><br><strong>This is from #2 of LESS, our journal of degrowth, radical sufficiency and decolonisation in Scotland. <a href="https://www.enough.scot/less/">Details of how to get a print copy here.</a></strong></p>



<p>The great shock caused by the total lockdown in spring of 2020 becomes more distant with each passing day. For months now, we have been living a “new normal” which is neither new, given that it continues to put capital and growth before life, nor in any way normal. Rather than grasping the opportunity presented by those months of lockdown when everything came to a standstill to undertake a radical change of direction, our societies have held on to fear and continuity, desperately struggling to ensure that everything remains the same and &#8211; as soon as possible &#8211; returns to normality, regularity and stability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We empathise with the suffering of many families and businesses which have found themselves obligated to confront situations of tremendous precarity due to the policies of governments such as the Spanish State. Nothing could be further from our intention than to suggest that these should be abandoned or left unsupported. However, it would be a serious mistake were we to fail to see that if the particular ways of living, producing, consuming, transportation etc. generated by industrial capitalist societies are to continue, then suffering in the near future will be much greater and probably affect all of humanity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The great problem we face is that, at a deep level, hardly anybody has understood that the Covid-19 pandemic is not an isolated and exceptional event, but rather a single moment in a much broader process: ecosocial collapse.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>“We struggle to see that the supposed normality constituted by the western societies of the second half of the 20th century are the true exception.”</strong></p>



<p>Although nearly everything which has happened in recent years makes it clear, we struggle to see that the supposed normality (opulent societies, which grow perpetually and have guaranteed access to fossil fuels) constituted by western societies in the second half of the 20th century are the true exception.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is these wealthy and unthinking societies which have squandered our fossil patrimony in order to support a Great Acceleration which has in the process devastated ecosystems, modified the climate, eroded the soils, contaminated water… And the massive wildfires, extreme weather events, droughts, economic crises and many other things which today flood our newspapers are no more than symptoms of that grave terminal illness which is the collapse of our civilisation. A collapse which we should not understand as a one-off or single event, but rather as a long process of decomposition which will affect different countries unequally, and within those, will be felt much more by the most vulnerable parts of the population.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Without understanding this, it is very unlikely that we will be able to really build a politics that puts life, freedom, equality and the stability of Gaia before everything else. At the end of the day, trying to return to a normal which never was is the very opposite of what we need today. Stability won’t return, growth will not continue and our way of life is taking its dying breaths. We are facing limits and damages caused by our dynamics of overshoot which make it not only undesirable, but impossible to carry on as though nothing were wrong. And ours is not merely a technical problem. The experts will not be able to discover a new technology that can resolve this, nor will State bureaucrats find some fail-proof policy which will allow us to continue with our lives as usual. Ours is a global and profoundly political problem. What is at stake is our way of life (which necessarily will have to change radically), and those who will bring about that change are people, organised collectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>“Stability won’t return, growth will not continue. We are facing limits and damages caused by our dynamics of overshoot which make it not only undesirable, but impossible to carry on as though nothing were wrong.”</em></strong></p>



<p>Despite the fact that those in power refuse to recognise it, major social and metabolic shifts await us in the near future. The Covid-19 pandemic has helped us to understand what these disruptions might look like, but the worst is yet to come. In the coming years, everything points to us living through energy scarcity which could transform into food shortages, problems accessing fuel, industrial shutdowns etc. We will also have to live with an increasingly unstable climate which, no matter what we do, will never return to the state of equilibrium which all agrarian human societies enjoyed until the present day. Heatwaves, droughts, super-storms and hurricanes, scarcity of fresh-water, melting glaciers… All of this has come to stay, and to challenge our urban model, our industrialised food system and our management of water.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Faced with all this, what will we do? Move ahead as though nothing were happening? Keep alive at all costs a suicidal industrial capitalism? Our obligation is to articulate a politics which navigates between limits and desire. Although it seems that we may have forgotten, last spring taught us something: it is possible to put people before capital. And that teaching is essential if we want the opportunity to collapse better, to guarantee dignified, free and equal lives in the new balance we have pushed Gaia towards. But that is not enough, because we have to put life before people. Life is not only human, it encompasses all the other animal and plant species. Only in that whole, the life of every single species is possible. We urgently need to dissolve our deeply-rooted anthropocentrism to put Gaia as a whole front and centre; as Jorge Reichmann says, we need to construct a political ethics capable of looking beyond the walls of the human city.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>“Our obligation is to articulate a politics which navigates between limits and desire. Although it seems that we may have forgotten, last spring taught us something: it is possible to put people before capital.”</strong></p>



<p>Let’s begin with the “easy” part: putting human life ahead means, in the first place, assuming and interiorising the limits of Gaia. Understanding that the illusions of infinite growth, unlimited abundance and nature as an inert object are inadequate frameworks for understanding what is happening to us: we need a New Earth Culture.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But that limit is also a limit to our own action, which must become a form of collective self-limitation. This is the best recipe to avoid all forms of authoritarianism, including that which has accompanied the State of Alarm [<em>translator’s note:</em> decreed by the Spanish State in response to the Covid-19 pandemic]. Are we capable of making choosing that which is indispensable for life a collective undertaking? Frugality and modesty are values which must come to substitute competition and ambition. Living well with less, we say in social ecology. At least with less energy, less consumption, less inequality, less injustice, less socio-ecological destruction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This also means placing limits on those who condemn us with their disproportionate hubris. We must unite amongst equals to build autonomous institutions that, on the one hand, free us from the expropriation which the elites impose on us through salaries and management. But which also force a redistribution of all the wealth unjustly accumulated by these elites. Therefore, ending wage work (the Spanish word used is “desalarizar”, literally to undo the wage relation) and constructing food, energy, technological and political sovereignty. The more autonomy we have, the more capable we will be of guaranteeing social needs without destroying and fighting, to self-limit ourselves in the embrace of Gaia, and at the same time, we will be better able to defend ourselves against the inevitable attacks of the elites and the States. Therefore, expropriating, sharing work and wealth, occupying or guaranteeing a living minimum for all who need it are basic policies. Lighting the way towards a force which constructs but also defends, setting in motion an exercise of collective self-limitation which can come to be an expression of freedom and social autonomy. In this study, we have outlined a route map for how this could be done for the Spanish economy during the decade 2020 – 2030.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>“The more autonomy we have, the more capable we will be of guaranteeing social needs without destroying and fighting, to self-limit ourselves in the embrace of Gaia, and at the same time, we will be better able to defend ourselves against the inevitable attacks of the elites and the States.”</strong></p>



<p>But this limit will never arrive if it is presented as a logical argument, as an unquestionable political conclusion. Our action has to navigate between limits and desire, because the latter is the only thing capable of activating and moving us. A desire which, in turn, will be found at the root of the conflict necessarily entailed by the scenario which we are outlining.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We cannot assume that power, neoliberalism, industrial capitalism have won once and for all the battle of desire, making us into beings capable only of desiring that which the State and the market offer us. We cannot because a true evaluation of limits prevents us from doing so, but above all, because the human being has shown throughout their history (as well as in the present) that they can live with dignity and in harmony with nature. That, therefore, is a horizon of desire anthropologically possible and a reality for many human societies, such as for example some Indigenous Peoples.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why are the siren calls of new proposals such as the Green New Deal (GND) so persuasive? Precisely because they claim to be able to bring together the need to accept limits with the widespread desire amongst western “middle classes” that almost nothing in our way of life need change. By all accounts a false solution, since the reality is that our desire to not have to change ourselves leads us to underestimate the scale of the exercise in self-limitation which we have before us, even the exercise of self-limitation which would be involved in any minimally realistic GND. As we explore in this study, a GND which approaches the emissions cuts recommended by the IPCC (which we know are ecologically insufficient), as well as promoting renewables would also have to invest in agroecology, decimate the private car, strongly restrict international aviation (tourism)… In short, an authentic overturning of neoliberal subjectivity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For that reason, it seems highly improbable that a minimally realistic GND, which implies profound transformations in our way of life, can become an option for parliamentary majorities in the short term (we will see what happens in the mid-term in a dramatically changing scenario such as that which we are living in). It is even less probable that any State will have the capacity or desire to make it reality, because not for nothing do they depend for their functioning on taxes and financial markets which, in turn, can only divert funds as a result of the reproduction of capital. What is even more important, the ecological struggles advocating for austere sufficiency and redistribution seem to be far from being in a position to set the rhythm for social coordination.</p>



<p><strong>“The construction of emergency landings in the collapse will have to navigate between the cracks and grey zones of the system, through disputes, and take as given that conflict is inevitable.”</strong></p>



<p>Thus, the construction of emergency landings in the collapse will have to navigate between the cracks and grey zones of the system, through disputes, and take as given that conflict is inevitable. On that path, there is no single or good solution. Nobody has an infallible solution. For that landing to succeed, we cannot assume that the transformation of desire, and therefore ways of life, are beyond possible or realistic political action. Our obligation is, instead, to politicise desire and connect with the old aspiration of social emancipation. Ours must also be an anthropological transformation, and thus we cannot accept that the triumph of neoliberalism in that sphere is irreversible. Or, if we do so, we will have to accept that the ecocide followed by genocide which could unfold under the worst scenarios of ecosocial collapse are also inevitable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Only if we are capable of longing to live in another way, only if we place the weaving of close social relations, time, fresh air, nature, meaningful work, and contact with the land before consumption, money or commodities will we be able to land in the least traumatic way possible. We need to work to reconstruct that which Mumford called the neolithic, and which today we can understand as a way of life that is communal, sustainable, just and autonomous. That is a key battle at the level of desire. In the report we cited earlier, the only scenario capable of respecting ecological limits was that in which we worked fewer hours in total. Of that work time, we would spend more time doing caring work in the household and less time in paid employment, either in the public or private sector. Morever, in that scenario a new kind of work would also emerge, one which is today almost non-existent, of communal work geared towards satisfying basic needs. A type of work which, potentially, has much more life-giving meaning than paid work. From our point of view, a scenario capable of stimulating desire for many people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the moment, desires for the most part still pivot between continuing as usual in the economic sphere, but accompanied by a consciousness that times are changing, and an ecological transition that would enable us to live more or less as we do currently, exemplified in the public discourse of the GND (if not in its hypothetical materialisation). The Trumps bet on the fossil economy, which is without doubt the most productive, at the same time that they strengthen the borders and imaginaries of confrontation which are essential to maintain their power in a structure which is cracking. They know how to read our times, according to their own interests, better than it would appear. Those who defend the GND start from a consciousness, at least partial, of the socioecological crisis, but they make promises impossible to fulfil and which do not match up to the ecological challenges, which are not only about energy, but much more complex. They deploy a horizon of desire with a very short range and high potential to cause disenchantment.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>“The great battle in the field of desire in the coming years or decades is not going to be over whether there is a transition towards a sustainable economy. That will happen inevitably. The dispute will be what kind of transition triumphs.”</strong></p>



<p>The great battle in the field of desire in the coming years or decades is not going to be over whether there is a transition towards a sustainable economy. That will happen inevitably. The dispute will be what kind of transition triumphs. On one side, the ecofascist or ecoauthoritarian: maintain high living standards for the elites, for which they will embrace conservationist discourses and the defence of “our own”. This is what the Nazi party did and what the European far-right is starting to do. <em>The Handmaiden’s Tale </em>would be a horizon of desire (for the elites) in a territory rendered lifeless by the Capitalocene.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other great horizon of desire is that which is made up of the sharing of work and wealth, simplicity, slowness, pleasure derived from dense social fabrics or intimate connection with nature. That connection based in knowledge, work and the love derived from both, as the neo-rural movements teach us. It is that which would enable us to materialise a socioeconomic transformation inspired by degrowth, relocalisation, integration into natural cycles (which is to say, an agroecological rather than industrial economy) and the distribution of wealth and power. This is the horizon of desire which is currently most hidden, least articulated and most interlaced with other contradictory desires, but which probably exists more than we think. It is that which drives those who long for early retirement or who use their holidays to go on pilgrimage. It is the desire which leads many to abandon the city and return to the land. It is also the desire of those who decide to work in cooperatives and escape the absurd impositions of growth. This will be the only desire compatible with what we might consider good lives when the lives which we previously called good (those of consumerism) are no longer feasible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is vital to make that horizon of desire grow now. Failure to do so will leave a gap in which the ecofascist desire can grow. And nothing makes desire grow more than seeing other people living happily. We need to encourage broad social sectors to want to imitate those who work in a cooperative with dignified working conditions doing socially necessary work, those who live in ecological buildings designed to maximise friendship and mutual aid, or those who eat delicious fruit picked directly from the tree they care for.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But that is not enough. We need to encourage desire recovering our capacity to dream of other economies and societies, something which today seems almost impossible because capitalism and the State, having enclosed our economic and political autonomy, have also cut the wings of our capacity to imagine other worlds. For that reason, in order to be able to dream big we must at the same time materialise our dreams. That is, construct autonomous lives which enable us to fantasize about autonomous societies and, on the way, position ourselves better to defend them when the moment arrives to do so.<br></p>

<p>LESS is a journal of degrowth, radical sufficiency and decolonisation in Scotland.&nbsp;Each issue ideas re-imagining our economy, mixing theory and grounded practice, examples of grassroots organisation and visionary ideas for a viable future. We publish in print and distribute across the UK, articles are also published online here.</p>



<p>Issue 2 examines degrowth and climate breakdown in a post-Brexit, mid-pandemic, pre-independent Scotland. </p>



<p>As the institutions and public sentiment of a degraded United Kingdom cultivate a protectionist and insular retreat from the world, it’s more important than ever to build political solidarity, intellectual networks, and cultural connections across Europe. In that spirit, this issue of LESS has contributions from Joachim Spangenberg (Vice President, Sustainable Europe Research Institute and Chair of BUND/Friends of the Earth Germany), a translation of work by Adrián Almazán and Luis González Reyes (&#8216;Between limit and desire: strategic directions in the collapse of industrial civilisation&#8217;) and an interview with activist, author and academic Andrea Vetter on degrowth principles by Svenja Meyerricks.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>LESS is a journal of degrowth, radical sufficiency and decolonisation in Scotland.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>LESS questions and challenges dominant narratives about what economic progress means in Scotland, and sketches out alternative visions. The focus is on collective and democratic solutions to sustaining livelihoods that meet people’s needs while rising to the threats of climate change, ecocide and mass extinction, inequality, racism and the far right, and the interconnected oppressive and extractivist logic that feeds all of these.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For our second issue we invite a combination of commentary relating to degrowth, opinion pieces, poetry and art work, as well as stories about practical action. Contributions are invited from people with lived knowledge in these areas, researchers, poets, creative writers and artists.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Meeting our needs in a place we call home&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The second issue of LESS will be looking at degrowth in the context of Brexit and the pandemic. We invite contributions around themes such as</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>co-creating welcoming communities in Scotland within ecological limits</li><li>strengthening and restoring alternative economies in Scotland and connections with European grassroots networks&nbsp;</li><li>post-pandemic recovery compatible with degrowth principles </li><li>resisting climate breakdown and the unraveling of our fragile ecosystems</li></ul>



<p></p>



<p><strong>To respond to the Open Call,</strong> please email your proposal of no more than half a page + a short bio or link to your work by Sunday, the 14th of February to info@enough.scot with &#8220;LESS2 proposal&#8221; in the subject line. We aim to get back to you within a few days to let you know if your piece has been accepted. </p>



<p>Upon receiving confirmation that your piece has been accepted, it should be submitted within a couple of weeks, and should be approximately 2000 &#8211; 3000 words in length for articles (although other formats are accepted). We pay a fee of £240 for each published piece.</p>

<p><strong>LESS is a journal on degrowth, radical sufficiency and decolonisation in Scotland.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>LESS questions and challenges dominant narratives about what economic progress means in Scotland, and sketches out alternative visions. The focus is on collective and democratic solutions to sustaining livelihoods that meet people’s needs while rising to the threats of climate change, ecocide and mass extinction, inequality, racism and the far right, and the interconnected oppressive and extractivist logic and mechanisms that feed all of those.&nbsp;</p>



<p>LESS features a combination of thoroughly researched material, opinion pieces, poetry and art work, with contributions from those with lived knowledge in these areas, researchers, poets, creative writers and artists.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Issue 1 asks: What does degrowth mean in Scotland during the pandemic and for plans for an economic recovery?</strong></p>
