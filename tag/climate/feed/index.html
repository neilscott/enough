										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Enough! has joined with another 115 charities, economists, businesses, trade unions and academics to send an open letter to Scotland’s First Minister calling for an “urgent transition to a Wellbeing Economy.” Read the statement here: &#8216;<a href="https://www.weallscotland.org/_files/ugd/d7012c_5be16a45f7c9463cbdbae2717202c7a6.pdf?index=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redesigning our Economy for People and Planet: Joint Statement on the Wellbeing Economy (weallscotland.org)</a>&#8216; and the text of the letter below.</strong><br><br><strong>The Enough! Collective believes in the principles and values of a wellbeing economy and supports efforts of civil society to exercise pressure on our government. And we also believe that deeper change won&#8217;t, in fact can&#8217;t happen when we are still wedded to an economic system based on perpetual growth and rampant exploitation.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Redesigning our economy is essential as considerable suffering and loss, resulting from our current economic model, are already being keenly experienced across the globe. For Enough!, well-being for all is only possible if we break with growth.</strong><br><br>Dear First Minister<br><br>We are writing to you as a group of social and environmental justice NGOs, grassroots community groups, faith groups, service providers, funders, economists, academics, think tanks and business leaders united in our belief that Scotland must urgently transition to a Wellbeing Economy.<br><br>Many of us are firefighting to provide frontline support to those swept up in the rising tide of destitution.<br><br>Others among us are trying to play our part in the transition to an economy that values people and the environment, for example, piloting new ways of providing for each other, running community energy projects and deploying alternative business models that contribute to our communities.  Others are directly involved in efforts to restore nature and tackle poverty.<br><br>Too many people in Scotland are living in cold homes, skipping meals and falling behind on rent while Scotland&#8217;s 20 richest families own more wealth than 30 percent of the poorest citizens combined. In the most deprived 30% of Scottish areas life expectancy is falling. At the same time, there are growing fears that Scotland’s legal emissions reductions targets will be missed and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recently warned that the world faces a &#8220;brief and rapidly closing window to secure a liveable future.&#8221; The IPCC also echoed our collective belief that GDP is a poor metric of human<br>wellbeing.<br><br>As a founding member of the Wellbeing Economy Governments partnership, Scotland has played an important role in building momentum for change among governments. We were pleased to see the aspiration to become a Wellbeing Economy contained within Scotland&#8217;s National Strategy for Economic Transformation. We also welcomed the publication of the first iteration of the Wellbeing Economy monitor, efforts to encourage fair work, support for community wealth building and the commitment to review how to increase the number of purposeful and democratic businesses in Scotland. And we are looking forward to seeing the recommendations of the Business Purpose Commission and Just Transition Commission being taken forward. These are steps in the right direction.<br><br>But we are writing to you today because we are concerned that progress isn’t happening fast enough to meet the very real and urgent challenges we face. To date, we have not seen substantive progress in redesigning our economy which continues to break planetary limits and create high levels of inequality.<br><br>With its narrow focus on GDP growth, the National Strategy for Economic Transformation is grounded in the same logic that has delivered decades of poverty, inequality and environmental degradation. What is required now is a robust plan to put the wellbeing of people and nature at the heart of our economy.<br><br>Today we have published a joint statement on what we envision such a Wellbeing Economy to look like in Scotland, which will require actions from governments in both Westminster and Holyrood.<br><br>As next steps on the journey to a Wellbeing Economy we ask you and the Scottish Government to use the powers at your disposal to:<br><strong>Transform the National Performance Framework into a Wellbeing Framework and strengthen its power and reach.</strong><br><br>● In the short-term, this requires a comprehensive engagement process to underpin the review of the National Outcomes so the people of Scotland have a voice in shaping what the framework measures.<br><br>● In the medium term, ensure the upcoming Wellbeing and Sustainable Development Bill puts the wellbeing framework on a stronger statutory footing to provide a clear vision for public bodies, bringing together and strengthening a range of duties to put collective wellbeing and environmental sustainability at the centre of decision-making. This should include enhanced support and scrutiny mechanisms, for example through the promised Future Generations’ Commissioner. The Scottish Government should also bring forward a clear outcome budgeting framework, evidencing how public spending delivers wellbeing outcomes.<br><br><strong>Use devolved tax powers to share Scotland’s wealth more evenly and support public investment in a strong social safety net, universal basic services, fair public sector wages and environmental improvements needed for a Wellbeing Economy.</strong><br><br>● In the short-term, the next Budget should continue progressive moves to increase tax revenue more fairly and clearly set out both the distributional impacts of this and how revenue will be invested in areas that can help Scotland progress to a Wellbeing Economy.<br><br>● In the medium term, the Scottish Government should undertake wide-ranging public<br>engagement to develop options to realise a fully progressive tax system, including more<br>fundamental reforms to income tax rates and bands, a clear roadmap for reforming /replacing the regressive council tax, and options to utilise local tax powers.<br><br><strong>Reshape the business environment in Scotland to facilitate a shift towards purposeful and democratic business practices that support collective wellbeing and environmental sustainability and do not profit from undermining either of them.</strong><br><br>● In the short-term, enterprise agencies and all public business support should prioritise<br>purposeful and democratic business practices, including social enterprises, cooperatives and employee-owned enterprises, as recommended by the Business Purpose Commission. All projects to support entrepreneurship, innovation and start-ups delivered as a part of the<br>National Strategy for Economic transformation should be focused on those businesses that can make the biggest contribution to a Wellbeing Economy and should be tailored to different rural and urban contexts.<br><br>● In the medium-term, fair work conditions on public sector grants and contracts should be<br>strengthened and extended to other dimensions of a Wellbeing Economy, including<br>environmental aspects and democratic governance structures. Options should be developed for better incentivising purposeful business – for example, reforms to non-domestic rates and the introduction of environmental levies.<br><br>Scotland is full of hopeful and inspirational action that is putting the Wellbeing Economy thinking into practice. But transforming such actions into the economy we all need will require bolder action by the Scottish Government to set the direction of the economy, it requires a stronger infrastructure for participation in economic policy-making, ensuring that seldom heard voices are listened to, and it requires increased public investment into places, people and nature to deliver what really matters to people.<br><br>We hope that you will consider our asks and we would be keen to meet to discuss this further.<br><br>Signed by<br>Ailsa Raeburn, Chair, Community Land Scotland<br>Alan McClouskey, Chief Executive, Voluntary Sector Gateway West Lothian<br>Alfie Stirling, Chief Economist, New Economics Foundation<br>Amanda Burgauer, Executive Director, Common Weal<br>Professor Andrew Cumbers, Professor of Political Economy, Adam Smith Business School, University of<br>Glasgow<br>Professor Andrew Watterson, Emeritus Professor of Health, Stirling University<br>Angus Hardie, Director, Scottish Community Alliance<br>Annette Hastings, Professor of Urban Studies, University of Glasgow<br>B.D.

<p><em>Affordable access to secure, decent housing was difficult enough for many before the pandemic. Afterwards, it’s even worse. Buyers fleeing urban environments for an ‘improved quality of life’ have created a particularly overheated property market in the Highlands and Islands. Rural areas already suffering from depopulation and chronic housing shortages for locals, especially young people, are at risk of becoming even more stratified. An underground network of rebel DIY housebuilders and campaigners are fighting back, finding ways to move through the cracks of a broken system to build the foundations for housing and land for all. LESS spoke to one of them, musician and strawbale self-build advocate Craig Bryce (Brycey) about life and work on the offgrid home he shares with his family at Cannich, in a woodland clearing overlooking Glen Affric. Brycey also shares his poetical reflections on COP26. The interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.</em> Illustrations by Owen McLaughlin.</p>

<p><strong>Luke Devlin (LD): How did you get from being involved in the punk scene, underground DIY music and anarchism in Glasgow to deciding you wanted to live in the Highlands? What did you learn from DIY underground culture that helped you in that journey</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> and what lessons can you take from that kind of non-hierarchical organising in order to find these opportunities within this really dominating environment?</strong></p>



<p>Brycey (B): We became exposed to the European squat scene and the idea that you can just set up whatever you need for yourself. It obviously needed you to have a physical space for that, and that just didn’t seem possible in a flat in Glasgow. Sitting in Glasgow in our early-20s we were going, ‘Right, in order to actually make that happen you have to live on the land and with the land.’ So myself and Angus [Quinn, vocalist of Brycey’s hardcore punk band, Sedition] moved to the Highlands way back then, and had a wee go at it. I ended up at the intentional community of Talamh. That was the thing that felt for me that we’ve got a physical space, we’ve got a foothold, and we’ve got collectivisation which allows us to have a way together bigger than our own individual resources.</p>



<p>I then realised that people with no assets, if they collectivised could buy an 18th century farmhouse and 16 acres of land. We made that happen, and then we realised that we could also tap into different things by getting funding, by being in different organisations and learning in so many different ways. So we could identify a skills gap at Talamh and then try and find some way of getting someone trained to do it.</p>



<p>That just felt like an extension of the DIY underground squat thing where you would just take a building and you would just look after yourself. The one that really sticks out was The Wohlgroth in Switzerland; it had everything from a women’s refuge to a clothes shop to a metal workshop, a wood workshop, a microbrewery.&nbsp;It had everything, right in the centre of Zürich, it was unbelievable. Completely blew me away that you could just get a bunch of people organising like that. So Talamh was a bit like a university for me in terms of giving me the idea that you can do that outwith the squat scene and within the landownership situation that happens within the UK. You can kind of circumvent it, through the power of collectivism.</p>



<p>I went down the career route of getting into doing outdoor education. Both my partner and I worked for a charity called Venture Trust out in Applecross, so we were living and working there, basically helping young offenders figure out how to get out of the court system and sort their lives out by taking them out on ten day expeditions and creating your own wee tribe, creating new value systems and helping people look at their lives differently. That helped us because we didn&#8217;t need to have a house, because there was tied housing or a caravan that you could stay in, so we were able to just save all our money. That meant we could start looking for land somewhere.</p>



<p>We didn&#8217;t want to end up with loads of debt or a mortgage, so that meant we needed to do it ourselves as much as possible and with the help of other people. So far, the whole build’s been done, apart from digging out the foundations, by myself and [my partner] Ele or friends and family and volunteers. We did get a company called Straw Works to come in, pioneers in straw bale housebuilding in the UK. They put the car tyre foundations in, the straw-bale walls, all the key skill bits like that, and ran those as courses with volunteers who wanted to learn that.</p>



<p>For the other bits, we’ve just watched Youtube videos! And asked for help from other people, and you really quickly tap into another community up here because it’s normal for folk to build their own houses, it’s not an unusual thing. You talk to the woman in the shop and she says, ‘Aye, I’ve built two,’ and it’s not a big deal at all, it’s dead normal. You meet someone and they’ll say, ‘Yeah, I grew up in a caravan until I was eight because my parents were building our house,’ and all that. It&#8217;s just a thing that happens here. And when at key points you need something, like you’ve got to do an Amish barn-raising or something, 15 people will turn up who have all built their own houses and understand what it feels like to be in that position and they’ll come and help you do that. You might be from very different walks of life and have different ideas politically, but it’s like, ‘No, we know about that, we’re going to come help you do that bit of your house.’</p>



<p>With our neighbours, we’re co-operating on getting the water and services set up, and we’ve made the decision to stay off-grid. We’ll probably end up with a micro-hydro and a mixture of wind and solar for the site.</p>



<p>We’ve lived off-grid basically for eight years here. So we were feeling smug when there was a power cut down in the village! We were at my dad’s the other night and all the lights went out and my wee boy Oran’s like, ‘What’s that?’ ‘It’s a power cut, son.’ ‘What’s a power cut?’ He couldn’t even understand the concept ‘cause we’re harvesting our own energy where we are.</p>

<p><strong>LD: In terms of the build and the skills and resources that were needed, what was your starting point in terms of construction knowledge?</strong></p>



<p>B: Yeah we knew absolutely fuck all about any of it man! Ele’s quite a voracious reader, she’ll research anything she wants to get into, so she did a whole design that was like a frame with straw bale infill. And then there was a course out in Elgin that the Straw Works people ran and [Ele] became really inspired. It’s a load-bearing straw&nbsp;bale build, so the walls are actually held up by the bales, so there’s quite minimal carpentry in it and it’s quite basic. So it feels quite accessible and achievable.</p>



<p>There’s been lots of bits of it so far where we’ve been like, ‘What are we doing?!’ But again, we’ve got a friend who’s been a really good help to us and has done more traditional buildings before and was like, ‘I’ll come help you put your roof truss in’, and it’s just been like, ‘Oh yeah, that guy knows that, I’ve got a mate that knows this,’ and then just researching it.</p>



<p>If you were a roofer you’d look at our roof and go, ‘Aye that’s a bit shonky,’ and if you were a carpenter you’d look at our verandas and go, ‘Urgh.’ But we’re not bothered about that because it’s felt really empowering to do it ourselves, it’s felt like quite a primal thing to create our own home. I think the only way we’ve been able to access stuff like that’s maybe been through things like up at Carbeth to build a hut up there, and there’s a community to help you. Whereas when you get into this kind of sustainable self-build, it just feels right – part of what we should be doing as a human being.</p>



<p>We’re on year three of it, but that’s because we’re trying to do it without a mortgage, so we’re not employing any tradespeople to come in because a) we can’t afford to, and b) we don’t really want to until we really need to. If it’s got to be signed off, like electrics, then we’ll have to do that, but we’re trying to do everything ourselves, and for that to be part of the whole thing. Which means it takes a lot longer, and it’s a bit frustrating.</p>



<p>But we’ve already helped other people, we’ve met other straw-bale folk that have started on that journey and we’ve been able to go and mentor them a wee bit and give them what they need – there’s a kind of reciprocity to it.</p>

<p><strong>L</strong><strong>D</strong><strong>: </strong><strong>What more support should there be for people that are wanting to do that?</strong></p>



<p>B: There are a lot of people just doing it! And obviously they don’t want to publicise it. There are people all over the Highlands that are like, ‘Right, I’m putting something in there and I’ll wait to see if they find me.’ And there are ways of doing it where you might be like, ‘Right, my build is like a forester’s hut where I stay when I’m working in the woods,’ and then eventually it gets a change of use on it. All these things are underground and DIY, and I think the Thousand Huts campaign from Reforesting Scotland is feeding into that, there’s a lot of skills going round that, even though the flipside of that is there’s a lot of people with loads of money that are turning it into a strictly middle class or upper class pursuit almost.</p>



<p>Some folk do manage to blog it and use it as training opportunities and things like that. I don’t have space to do that, I’m barely able to be involved in anything else other than building the house, looking after my family, and doing the work I need to do.</p>



<p>It needs to be broken down for people to really repopulate and be here and live and work on the land in a way that’s beneficial and supports a lot of folk and reverses the rural depopulation trend. The Airbnb thing’s only made it worse. Young folk just cannae get a hoose. It’s not new to the Highlands, but it’s intensifying more and more. You add COVID into that and everyone leaving the cities to come to their ‘rural idyll’; and the carbon credits, Brewdog creating a fucking forest to pretend they’re carbon neutral. There’s a lot of pressure that makes landownership even more tricky to get to.</p>



<p><strong>LD: There is a challenging element to the commitment you’ve made that tests you to a certain extent, and forces you to maybe become more resilient and increase your capability in terms of exposure to taking care of your fundamental ne</strong><strong>eds in a way that isn’t about just buying a product or buying a service, because you have to do it yourself. What have been the main lessons you have learned about what really matters in life, and what are the most important things about human flourishing?</strong></p>



<p>B: The things that on the surface other folk would be like, ‘Woah, are you mad?,’ like having to go and smash the pond with a sledgehammer to get water out of it because everything is frozen solid in the middle of the winter or whatever. We could have better systems in place that would mean we wouldn’t have to do that, that’s the thing, problem solving. You can’t buy a product to do that because you’re like, ‘Right, so we need to get water from a pond all the way up the hill to come down to our caravan somehow.’ So you’ve got to problem-solve everything that way. And that, again, feels really empowering. Then when you’ve got your roasting hot, pummeling 12 volt shower and you’re like, ‘Yes, we did it!’ Now it’s broken, so I’m not boasting that much! But all those systems that we had to figure out at first, it’s just a total learning journey that makes you feel a sense of self-worth that wouldn’t happen if you were just buying a product to solve those problems.</p>



<p>We’re really lucky&nbsp;– the elements here, when it’s windy, you know it’s windy; when it’s cold, you know it’s cold. When we actually get the build finished and move in, we’re moving ourselves slightly away from that to a different level of comfort that’s going to feel really strange because we’ve lived like this for eight years now. And when it gets to the deep winter this year and it’s -10°C again, and the whole site you can’t drive a vehicle onto for maybe four months, and there’s ice on the inside of the bedroom windows, there’s points where you’re like, ‘Urgh.’ But there’s points where you do need to just dig a little deeper. And just that kind of slight life-threatening adversity brings something else out of you as a human being. And we do use technology. We watch films, we’re chatting on Zoom now, we sit and play music, we do other things&nbsp;– it’s not as if we’re sitting here carving spoons all night with a candle on. But it is different from living in a city with technology surrounding you as a thing that you just turn to all the time.</p>



<p>You just naturally spend more time in awe of nature. You’ve got to get your wood to bring down for the burner and you’re looking at the view, or you see a red kite flying above you. You just feel a connection that you don’t get unless you’re living a bit closer to the land like this. And I think that moves also to having a spiritual connection, a feeling much more of belonging to where you are. I’ve bought a bit of land but I don’t really believe in landownership, but I did it because I didn’t want anyone to be able to take the housing that I have away from me and I wanted to be empowered by that. Also observing the Celtic calendar and all that –&nbsp;you’re in that tradition, you’re playing that music, you’re hearing that language, you’re hearing the wind and the rain and it’s all part of what enriches your life. We feel really lucky. Especially when COVID happened, we couldn’t be in a better place. We grow as much of our food as we can, we use an organic veg box, and I get most of the rest of my food from Highland Wholefoods. We rarely deal with supermarkets, we’ve removed ourselves a little bit from that.</p>



<p>Even the house; all the windows were bought second hand, as much as we can. We felled and milled all the wood on site here ourselves. Instead of going and buying the timber, you actually get your mates and chop the trees down and mill them yourself, and you just do that with everything. It’s just part of how you try and operate. And it saves you a lot of money now as well, because the prices are insane. We’ve got our wood out there for the rest of the build, and if we had to buy that now, we’d not be able to.</p>



<p>I do feel more centred as a human being – with my family on the land, doing what I’m doing – than I ever have in my life. And there’s lots of reasons for that, but I think it is that thing of thinking, ‘Right, I’m putting my roots down here and this is a long term thing.’ And it’s not, ‘Oh, then we can sell the house and move somewhere else and move up the ladder,’ and all that. This is for Oran, when I’m away this is Oran’s house, and hopefully his family’s place if that’s what he wants. Once we’ve moved on from the house being built, we’ll try and get a self-sustaining ecosystem here which is also inclusive for people to come and enjoy. I wouldn’t rule out us trying to get involved in helping people access this kind of thing in a more formal way once we have finished everything, because it’s important to me to not just be like, ‘We’re sorted now,’ and then sit back.</p>

<p><strong>L</strong><strong>D</strong><strong>: </strong><strong>What are your thoughts on sharing that learning about relationship and reciprocity that you mentioned with </strong><strong>folk that are living in cities who either are not going to have the opportunity to do it or maybe don’t want to? Many want to live in a city, or have to, but how people live in cities has to change drastically as well.</strong></p>



<p>B: It’s as simple as collective organisation&nbsp;–&nbsp;something like GAS [Glasgow Autonomous Space] being there now, or even the Kinning Park Complex and the way that operates.&nbsp;There’s lots of small scale things like that already happening, and they are all actually there, it’s just that you don’t hear about it. I think it will scale up, I don’t think it’s going to drop away suddenly. Going back to COP26 and the bigger picture of it, like Greta Thunberg is saying, the way capitalists are going to ‘fix’ climate change, capitalism and climate change are interlinked – the thing we keep coming up against is land and property ownership. I don’t mean just demonstrations, but just linking up as communities and creating these autonomous spaces as well, and then networks will just keep growing. Because people are realising that the people in power are not doing it and are not going to do it. Mutual aid basically, anarchism. Who are the people stepping up and getting things done at the refugee camps? It’s not the authorities. It’s mutual aid. It’s that spirit that underpins everything.</p>



<p>It needs more direct action activism, but what Talamh and the Pollok Free State really taught me is that you can’t spend all your energy going against what you don’t like as it leaves very little to create what you do like. I think that’s tipped over a bit now and loads of people are building what they do like, and seeing those networks, just small groups and collectives of people who are working together – that’s the only way I can kind of see this knowledge spreading out without getting greenwashed or co-opted.</p>



<p>I do worry that it’s too slow –&nbsp;because the power of what it’s up against in terms of resurgent fascism and climate change, and the way that the powers that be seem to be able to just manipulate the media narrative. My only way of staying sane against that is to actually just link up with people and go and do what you want to happen.</p>



<p>And whether that’s being at COP and having the demonstrations and all the rest of it, or creating a food garden in your local area and teaching people how to grow in an urban setting. And making sure places don’t get gentrified and developed, there’s green space, cycle routes, all these little victories. You can’t expect these powers that be to change because they rely so heavily on the profit motive, they don’t seem to understand that GDP shouldn’t be all we focus on. It’s starting to happen, but it needs to happen now.</p>



<p>Our society is fragile and vulnerable because we’ve been deskilled so much in that way, we just phone someone these days, you don’t do it yourself. Things like tool libraries and being able to actually share that expertise is key. I’m not being totally prepper about it, but industrial society is not going to be able to keep going the way it is, so you need a different set of skills to transition through that. And that includes the ability to be able to organise co-operatively and interact with each other that doesn’t involve hierarchies and coercion. And that’s such a valuable skill that we’re really going to need.</p>



<p>As a movement to become something bigger and stronger, it has to involve the people in the schemes as well. I remember there was a group called the Milton Class War Casuals and they were mad techno heads, but they looked like a bunch of mad neds that just went out clubbing, but they were switched on politically. If you had all the schemes like that, the power that is sitting in those communities if they were plugged into all these things as well. Resistance to capitalism and what’s happening with climate is pretty white and middle class and that’s something that really needs to change.</p>

<p>During the global pandemic, Naomi Klein asked the newly furloughed classes, those of us who could afford the luxury of isolation, the ones framed in opposition to ‘key workers’:</p>



<p><strong>“What are we if not essential? Are we being kept like pets? For who?”</strong> (1)</p>



<p>At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, 30% of the UK’s workforce was furloughed. (2) For many of the people who make up Scotland’s ‘professional classes’, COVID-19 presented an existential, ideological crisis. As we stayed in our jammies, kneading dough and learning Tiktok dances, there was a realisation of our redundancy. When modern identity is realised through optimisation and productivity, this new reality hurt some egos. Thousands clambered towards a sense of usefulness, with record numbers signing up to lend support in their communities through Volunteer Scotland and the British Red Cross. (3) The term ‘self-isolation’ became locked into our daily lexicon, as we barricaded ourselves inside for 23 hours per day. A hurried exchange with a faceless delivery driver or an hour of daily exercise was the only moment of physical external engagement.</p>



<p>We experienced a novel psychological phenomenon, a new ‘us’ and ‘them’: the key worker and the captive other. There were the real workers, the ones who literally and metaphorically lifted our nation through crisis – supermarket workers, carers, waste collectors, delivery drivers, teachers, healthcare workers. Many ‘professionals’ did not make the cut. In 2013, David Graeber gave a veneer of academic rigour to Tom Leonard’s image of the “liaison coordinator” (4):</p>



<p><strong>“Huge swathes of people, in Europe and North America in particular, spend their entire working lives performing tasks they secretly believe do not really need to be performed. The moral and spiritual damage that comes from this situation is profound. It is a scar across our collective soul.”</strong> (5)</p>



<p>We are in the era of the ‘Bullshit Job’, where cultural aspiration for social mobility and a political drive for closing the attainment gap has encouraged us to present as ambitious and upwardly mobile, regardless of whether the job we aspire towards is useful or not. This often includes the incentive to leave the community that nurtured and sustained us, physically and imaginatively. I grew up under this narrative. It’s an ideology that encourages us to talk about our hometowns as ‘dead ends’, to valorise those who ‘got out’.</p>



<p>The UK Government’s Social Mobility Commission defines ‘social mobility’ as “the link between a person’s occupation or income and the occupation or income of their parents. Where there is a strong link, there is a lower level of social mobility. Where there is a weak link, there is a higher level of social mobility.”</p>



<p>By definition, the weaker your link to your working-class roots, the more ‘successful’ you are. In Scotland’s collective consciousness, there has always been an aspiration for getting up and getting out. According to Tom Devine, an estimated 2.3 million people left Scotland for overseas opportunities between 1825 and 1938 (6): “Scotland’s biggest export in the nineteenth and twentieth century has been people.” (7) This trend of outward migration – or “export” – continued into the twenty-first century, with a population loss of approximately 825,000 between 1952 and 2006. (8) Recognising how our push for social mobility has been a key part of Scotland’s colonial narrative makes us feel uncomfortable. Playing the underdog is part of our nation-building, so the reality of Scotland’s historical role in the UK’s imperial enterprise, and the more recent propagation of the neoliberal agenda around the world, is often avoided. This country is the birthplace of the industrial revolution and the destructive, linear economic ideology that baked-in the whole system of overconsumption, waste, and exploitation.</p>



<p>The pandemic picked scabs that many had tried to ignore. For those of us who took the social mobility pill, and aspired to get up and get on, the revelation that we are not contributing much to society is hard to swallow. Social mobility is typically linked to moving away from traditionally operational and menial occupations into physically sedentary, strategic roles. When our jobs are more paper-pushing than purposeful, the only signifiers of wealth, success, and ‘usefulness’ left available to us are presented through consumption of goods and services. We saw this ideology from the UK Government during the pandemic, with Eat Out To Help Out (9) and easing of restrictions for high-street chain stores – a rally cry for us to consume our way out of economic crisis. At the peak of the pandemic, as the furloughed classes clicked and scrolled, filling our digital baskets to save the economy, the UK’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson stated that “there really <em>is</em> such a thing as society.” (10) Famously, Margaret Thatcher had interjected:</p>



<p><strong>“…and who is society? There is no such thing! There are individual men and women and there are families and no government can do anything except through people and people look to themselves first.”</strong> (11)</p>



<p>It seemed that in the face of a global pandemic, society was the only thing that was real, and we all played our part within it. But what is often overlooked from this infamous interview with Douglas Keay of <em>Woman&#8217;s Own</em> magazine is Thatcher’s ambition for the façade of success expressed through material consumption. When asked what she was personally looking forward to achieving, she replied:</p>



<p><strong>“&#8230;spreading the outward and visible signs of success ever more widely… You have to inspire their own efforts and then not take so much away from them that they have not the chance to go on improving themselves and increasing their personal property to their own and family&#8217;s advantage.”</strong></p>



<p>Boris Johnson may have signed on to society, but when it comes to how that society functions, we are living Thatcher’s blueprint. We work to consume and accumulate signifiers of wealth, i.e. more stuff. The pandemic did not disturb that core truth. In fact, it reinstated consumption as a key pillar of the good society. And as much as having wealth and nice stuff is a real and worthy pursuit for many, the reality of ‘accumulation as success’ has found us consuming approximately 18.4 tonnes of resources per person per annum in Scotland. (12) </p>



<p>We are surrounded by cheap stuff, designed to become obsolete, destined for a long, lonely life in landfill. All the while, as our homes become more cluttered, there’s a growing vacuous space inside ourselves and our communities. Average ratings of life satisfaction and happiness are all declining in the UK, with ratings of happiness in Scotland falling by 1.2% as of March 2020. (13)</p>



<p>The distinction between ‘key workers’ and the rest of us only exacerbated this tension, as David Graeber had identified:</p>



<p><strong>“Real, productive workers are relentlessly squeezed and exploited. The remainder are divided between a terrorised stratum of the, universally reviled, unemployed and a larger stratum who are basically paid to do nothing, in positions designed to make them identify with the perspectives and sensibilities of the ruling class (managers, administrators, etc) – and particularly its financial avatars – but, at the same time, foster a simmering resentment against anyone whose work has clear and undeniable social value.”</strong> (14)</p>



<p>The furloughed classes faced the reality of their own redundancy in the social hierarchy, whilst looking out the window at the hardship faced by key workers, many of whom were also experiencing low pay, job insecurity, and poor working conditions. It was clear that the lives of key workers were simultaneously essential and disposable: healthcare workers without adequate PPE, teaching staff in front of classes but not prioritised for vaccinations, those propping up our supply chains expected to work longer hours in dangerous conditions… As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, 79% of the UK public now believe there is a large gap between different social classes and over half the public think the pandemic has increased social inequality. (15)</p>



<p>We can see it for what it is: an exploitative, empty system that pushes stuff around. A system that truly benefits no one (even the rich!) and pillages our natural world in the process. The social mobility dream makes sense. We want people to have opportunity, jobs, and adequate income, but this cannot be at the expense of our planetary boundaries. Without any meaningful reduction on resource consumption, all our social mobility ambitions are just working towards equal opportunities for anyone, from any background, to have the chance to exploit other people and the planet and harm their own wellbeing in the process.</p>



<p>There is an environmental imperative to decouple social mobility from growth and resource consumption. If Scotland is serious about reducing resource consumption, then we must wrestle with our materialistic culture, which is directly linked to aspiration and social mobility. People with more money consume more stuff: “around half the emissions of the richest 10% (24.5% of global emissions) are associated with the consumption of citizens of North America and the EU”, and “in the past 20-30 years, more carbon has been emitted by the “consumption [habits] of the already affluent, rather than lifting people out of poverty.” (16)</p>



<p>At present, we enjoy the benefits of our colonial past, continuing to push the environmental, social, and economic burden of our mass consumption on to the countries we import our products from. Our reliance on overseas economies for our stuff allows us to also export the carbon emissions associated with their production. Around 46% of the UK’s carbon footprint is emissions released overseas to satisfy UK-based consumption, and this figure is not accounted for in national reporting of our emissions. (17) Moreover, when the electronics, clothing, and plastic toys are broken or out of fashion, we send much of the waste back overseas for someone else to deal with.(18)</p>



<p>Right now, we are trying to put ourselves and our communities back together after a global pandemic. But during this process, and as the UN’s COP26 environmental conference comes to Glasgow in November 2021, there is much reflection on what its ‘Building Back Better’ looks like for Scotland. For Zero Waste Scotland’s ‘Decoupling Advisory Group’, which brought together a range of independent thinkers from across Scotland and beyond, solutions must focus on “reducing Scotland’s consumption of goods and materials absolutely, rapidly, permanently and fairly” (19) and decoupling economic growth from resource use. We need to see a logic of “care and repair” (20) built into government policy, into our businesses, and communities. We need wellbeing and meaningful work to be at the centre of our economic system, if we have any chance of saving ourselves from drudgery, mental health problems, and growing inequality.</p>



<p>All our lives we have been told that we modern consumers are magpies, always scraping and searching for the next shiny thing. But it turns out that the link between consumerism and wellbeing is about as real as the thieving-magpie myth: it turns out magpies do not steal shiny things, but in fact have “neophobia – fear of new things”. (21) We are not magpies, and we do not need to be defined by tired myths of aspiration as the accumulation of stuff. If the pandemic has taught us anything, it’s that we long for meaningful connection, that we want to cultivate our communities and nurture skills to play a part in society. We have a chance to reframe social mobility away from consumption, creating aspiration to lead a meaningful life, with security, happiness, and freedom at its heart. It all starts with stepping away from stuff.</p>

<p>Fresh rainfall shimmers on the aspen below, there&#8217;s a break in the weather and we sit on the promontory at Dunbeag on the Cowal peninsula looking across the valley to the Isle of Bute, with Inshmarnock in the distance. To our right is the peninsula of Ardlamont and the Isle of Arran. Beyond the huge glass doors, guinea fowl walk the decking, while nuthatches share the bird-feeder with a passing red squirrel. An ancient spaniel guards the threshold.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sat with my neighbour David Blair at his home on the outskirts of Tighnabruaich. It is a glorious, celebratory day for an interview. “I&#8217;ve built the ark,” he says, “and so far it&#8217;s having the effect I hoped it would”. Between us and our cups of tea on the kitchen table is a copy of this week’s <em>Dunoon Observer and Argyllshire Standard</em>, dated Friday 1<sup>st</sup> October 2021.</p>



<p>In bold type on the front page is the headline &#8216;Council Declares Climate Emergency&#8217;. The first paragraph begins, “Three weeks ago a symbolic ark appeared above Tighnabruaich with its builder David Blair saying &#8216;Argyll &amp; Bute Council has not declared a climate emergency&#8217;”.</p>



<p><br>&nbsp;I ask David if it&#8217;s been a long time coming&#8230;. He tells me, “I felt I was being fobbed off and it didn&#8217;t seem they were taking it seriously enough, and so the ark seems to have promoted that change pretty rapidly, three weeks from its completion – and that&#8217;s it declared”.</p>



<p>David is emphatic, alight in his conviction, “I think COP26 is the most important meeting of human beings ever on this planet. If this really is our last chance to save ourselves from ourselves and actually deal with this situation of climate change, the meeting is fundamental to this happening. We need action, not just the youth, we all do; we need to see it happening.”</p>



<p>As I sit cradling tea and taking this all in, I begin to reflect on an a <em>Guardian</em> article that broke the news of the Kyles Ark. I&#8217;m curious about a reference David made there of appealing directly to people’s hearts as a way of bypassing the numbness that comes with waves of apocalyptic messaging. I ask him about it.</p>



<p><strong>David Blair (DB):</strong> The ark was a way of trying to go beyond all that talk and create something that people would recognise as a form, then connect that with the story of the great flood; and then link that without any interpretation to sea level rises today, and the extinction crises which I feel is very relevant today.</p>



<p>When I&#8217;ve been up there, nearly everyone is aglow, it touches people emotionally, there&#8217;s a connection to that form, a story which we&#8217;ve learned from picture-books since we&#8217;ve been very young. It reminds them of something from their childhood.</p>



<p><strong>Rhyddian Knight (RK): </strong>Where did the seed or conception of the idea come from?</p>



<p><strong>DB:</strong> I had the idea over 20 years ago; I&#8217;ve been here 26 years. I did think I&#8217;d build it up on the duinn; back then the majority would not have made the connection. I nearly built it last year, in the run up to COP26, but if I built it during the pandemic they wouldn&#8217;t have got the right impression. Now was the right time to do it. We started milling the wood in February and March from larch that was being felled to waste from within three miles. It was important to use the larch. It was diseased with <em>Phytophthora ramorum</em>, imported by humans and exacerbated by climate change. Because of its susceptibility to the disease, larch is a species we are likely to lose in Scotland in the next few decades. If <em>Phytophthora ramorum</em> gets into the Sitka, that&#8217;s the end of Scottish forestry.</p>



<p>I did a lot of surveying, as it had to be the right place in the landscape for it to make sense. If it was too far back, it wouldn&#8217;t look like it was &#8216;ready to launch&#8217;. When the time came, we put it up in two weeks. I wanted it to spring up so that it created the biggest impact. If it had gone through extensive planning approvals, I felt the impact would have been diluted by the process.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve since engaged with the planning department and am applying for change of use for the field to allow the construction of environmental art.<br><br>The aspect is good. It&#8217;s not in your face, or intrusive from the village; you have to look for it.</p>

<p><strong>Raising an ark</strong></p>



<p>As far as symbols go, this structure is huge in scale. Built with a small group of people over a fortnight on a local hill under the radar from the authorities, I feel a sense of mischievousness just talking about the project. I ask David what the process of building was like for him.</p>



<p><strong>DB:</strong> It was a buzz, it was full on. We started on a Monday and had a couple of hours working out a plan for the base frame – keeping our heads low below the skyline. We built five lower frames, then put them all up and joined them together on the Wednesday. It was one day, and already there was a big structure on the hill.</p>



<p>We were a great team; it was my brother Rob and my friend Scott Smith.</p>



<p><strong>RK</strong>: I&#8217;ve been calling you guys &#8216;Guerrilla builders&#8217;, did you encounter any flack while it was going up or were you shielded from that?</p>



<p><strong>DB:</strong> As soon as the five frames went up, it was very visible on the skyline and there was no hiding. We just had to get on with it. The next day, I got an email from the planning authority saying, “There&#8217;s a structure on the hill, can you direct me to who the landowner might be?” I wasn&#8217;t asked who was building it, so I gave them the postal address of the landowner, who is entirely supportive – in the lease for the field that I took out it mentions the building of an ark in the plans. I gave the postal address so that planning had to get in touch with him in writing. We&#8217;d finished building it before the planning authority came back to me, which is what I wanted.</p>



<p><strong>RK: </strong>I&#8217;d always assumed you didn&#8217;t need planning permission to build a boat&#8230;</p>



<p><strong>DB:</strong> They weren&#8217;t particularly pleased I&#8217;d done that. They actually blocked the secondary school from visiting. They wanted to come out on an educational trip, interview me and learn about climate change and COP 26. The council wouldn&#8217;t let them have transport to come out because I didn&#8217;t have planning for it; which I thought was really shocking. They seem more interested in red tape than the future.</p>



<p><strong>RK: </strong>That can be tiring&#8230; right?</p>



<p><strong>DB:</strong> It was good to get it out of my head. I didn&#8217;t have any proper drawings, so the whole ark was occupying a space in my head. That design process continued all the way through the build, making sure it was right, strong; robust. It was a full on process. We built an average of four or five hours a day. I estimated the build was roughly 180 human hours. It was a push, but it was exactly what I hoped it would be. Since it was built, I&#8217;ve been riding the wave of interest, and publicity and inquiry.<br><br>I just need to see governments taking things seriously now. The crisis has got to a point where it’s beyond individual public actions. We need them to unite behind this single issue, above all other issues, finding a way forward that stabilises global temperatures below warming of 1.5°C. We&#8217;re already up to 1.2°C and we are seeing the wildfires, and the storms and the floods around the world has been shocking.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s an exponential thing; I likened it to watching a pot of water coming to the boil. You see the initial swirls as it&#8217;s heating, the more it heats the more crazy it gets; it speeds up and up with every degree. It&#8217;s a similar thing with our climate. It&#8217;s absolutely critical to save ourselves from ourselves and tackle the climate and ecological emergency.</p>



<p><strong>RK:</strong> It&#8217;s like the bedrock of culture, isn&#8217;t it?</p>



<p><strong>DB:</strong> Unless we can stabilise the climate, then all other aspirations of humanity become nothing in the face of an overheated planet.</p>

<p><br><strong>Creative process as a life raft</strong></p>



<p>I become intensely curious, suddenly inquisitive in my focus, I want to know what keeps those among us who are acutely aware of teetering on the edge of oblivion healthy? What impulse or attribute is it that allows us to respond in a relational way? I want to know if there are any principles here that can help and nurture cultural creatives and leaders in communities to respond in the midst of catastrophe. I adjust my inner compass, reach for some hazelnuts on the table to crack open, and head off in that direction.</p>



<p><strong>RK:</strong> Has this realisation been with you a long time?</p>



<p><strong>DB: </strong>I&#8217;ve been aware of the climate and ecological emergency for over 30 years now. It&#8217;s what brought me here. I came to escape, because humanity seemed desperate to head over a cliff. I was saddened to hear recently that 66% of 16-25 year olds feel that humanity is doomed. Thirty years ago we were maybe 1%, but now it&#8217;s more than half of the youth think we don&#8217;t have a chance and I think that&#8217;s desperately sad.</p>



<p>They need to see governments acting with boldness and conviction, that&#8217;s the only way we&#8217;re going to solve the crisis of anxiety from the youth. This is the big one.</p>



<p><strong>RK: </strong>You need to see adults being congruent between their actions and their words?</p>



<p><strong>DB:</strong> I must admit, I&#8217;m just not seeing it.</p>



<p><strong>RK:</strong> If we are considering a large proportion of our youth have woken up to the climate emergency, and you&#8217;ve lived with that realisation for 30 years, you could call it a burden, right?</p>



<p><strong>DB:</strong> It is a burden, it’s not a comfortable thing to live with, it&#8217;s like something always in the back of the mind.</p>



<p><strong>RK:</strong> So what are the things that have kept you going in the midst of that burden then?</p>



<p><strong>DB:</strong> I guess trying to do something about it. I&#8217;m restoring and living in a bit of semi-natural and ancient oak woodland. I&#8217;ve learned to build with it. I&#8217;ve started the Kilfinan Community Forest to try and give other people the chance to build themselves. I&#8217;ve installed hydro schemes and tried to involve myself with trying to do what ever I can in this village to make life more sustainable.</p>



<p>A lot of people thought I was aiming for self sufficiency, and we do grow a lot of our own food, we keep poultry, my wife goes fishing and butchers local venison from the hill. We try to eat as local as possible from the area. None of that makes any difference if the worlds’ leaders don&#8217;t do the big stuff. But that&#8217;s how I dealt with it, by totally focusing and putting all my energy into trying to live more sustainably and encourage that opportunity in the district.</p>



<p><strong>RK:</strong> When you do that, what do you get?</p>



<p><strong>DB:</strong> It&#8217;s been a great journey! Right now, we are sitting in our home we built 3 years ago. It&#8217;s wood, it&#8217;s got a Passivhaus Standard; by far the most high-spec house I&#8217;ve built – others have been quite rustic, in the winter we used to have to have the wood stove on 24/7.</p>



<p>The journey has brought me to a really good place. By focusing on this underlying issue, it&#8217;s directed my life towards trying to do things locally and sustainably&#8230; and it&#8217;s great! I really think in a low-carbon future the world will be a better place for people. Everyone&#8217;s feart – we are not going to be able to do anything and it&#8217;s going to restrict our personal freedoms – but actually I just think people will be more connected to each other, more connected to their local area, more engaged with what&#8217;s happening around them. We need to restore our landscapes&#8230; and that could be a beautiful and empowering and heartening thing.<br><br>I think humans ultimately need to have connection with other humans; we don&#8217;t exist well in isolation. The last couple of years with the pandemic have been really hard on people. We&#8217;ve learned what it means to exist in isolation, which hasn&#8217;t happened in recent history. I think we thrive on human contact but also on connection with our human habitat. Connection with our soils, you know, connection with where our food comes from; connection with everything that&#8217;s around us.</p>



<p><strong>RK: </strong>I&#8217;m hearing what you’re saying, but I&#8217;m also really with this youth statistic you were speaking of&#8230;</p>



<p><strong>DB:</strong> The future is theirs, it’s really up to the elders to give them a chance to have a future. I feel so much for the youth of today, I guess because I&#8217;ve been feeling like they do for so much of my life. For the majority of the youth worldwide to feel humanity is doomed is a really poor start, and I hope they feel that anger and channel it into action, whether that&#8217;s through lobbying politicians or through creating a new life that&#8217;s looking toward a sustainable future.<br></p>



<p><strong>Commons as Ark, Ark as Commons</strong></p>



<p>It&#8217;s at this point that I realise these pronouncements, though inspired, are underscored with a great deal of humility, self-understatement and huge effort. David first came to Dunbeag and lived in a tent in the forest, then a hand hewn workshop, and the succession of nested buildings around me tell a story of habituating sustainably over decades.</p>



<p>Today, drinking tea amidst abundant terraces of fruit and nut crops, hectares of sensitively regenerated woodland, hydroelectric-pipes hand dug through miles of mountainside, in a passivhaus designed, milled, built green and dried in situ, there is an attention to detail evident in the craftsmanship that is borne of mindful observation of and in nature. It is directly apparent what energy channelled into creative process can really look like.</p>



<p>To the west, the 561 hectares comprising Kilfinan Community Forest, now fourteen years young, has it&#8217;s own hydro scheme and harbours a number of sustainable micro businesses. Now the parish boasts self-builders raising timbers on affordable housing plots, woodland crofters restoring land once lost in the maw of commercial forestry. It is an enlivening place containing allotments, orchards, and an extensive path network. The charity has even initiated devolved systems of decision making.</p>



<p>Interestingly, all of these regenerative processes, ark included, are visible in the landscape at different vantage points from David’s home at Dunbeag. Reaching out to world leaders with an actual ark in a neighbouring field feels like a very reasonable and embedded gesture to perpetuate the self-determinative arc David has set forth for his local community.</p>



<p><strong>RK:</strong> What would you say about the ark as a meeting place for folk?</p>



<p><strong>DB:</strong> I&#8217;m overjoyed when I see people up there; that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s for. I created it to be a physical meeting space. There is a bench seat that runs right round the base of the ark, you could fit 60 or 70 people in there. It could be a space for outdoor conference almost. Last week, the primary school were up, all 50 kids were all within the ark getting a chat from the local minister. I do hope that it finds itself as a space where people can meet, to contemplate, to talk, to share; to discuss.</p>



<p><strong>RK:</strong> We are just one coastal community amongst many. If someone was reading this with their own idea they&#8217;ve been sitting on, would we have a message for them?</p>



<p><strong>DB</strong>: Go for it. The more we can raise the bar, the more we can up the ante with this, whatever way that&#8217;s possible. Creativity is certainly a way, the arts; someone recently suggested we have a coalition of artists for the planet&#8230;. to be building stuff, painting stuff, whatever form of art they practice. Just make it about <em>Now</em>, make it about the planet and this critical point in time that we occupy right now.</p>



<p>A light rain falls, a blue-tit visits the feeder. The spaniel’s nose is on the window pane looking in. I open the door for him and ask David if there has been anything left unsaid.</p>



<p><strong>DB:</strong> I had a retired human rights activist that&#8217;s really keen to see it promoted in Glasgow for COP26, have it projected on and in buildings to try and encourage delegates to think big. The hope is some of the delegates will decide to take a break from the conference and come out to Tighnabruaich and see a little bit of what Scotland&#8217;s all about and see how beautiful our coastlines are.</p>



<p>The finished construction is every bit as beautiful as it was in my head. I had in my mind it would be like living in the skeleton of a giant whale or something, a huge rib cage; it does feel like that it’s a beautiful structure. I enquire as to the future of the Kyles Ark, David Blair is buoyant: “It&#8217;s over to what everyone&#8217;s imaginations can think of.”</p>

<p>For me when you look at the realities of climate change it’s been majorly driven by industrialisation. Industrialisation is hyped to countries in Africa as a good thing. No one is telling them that this model has failed. If that message comes from countries like the UK then people and governments here will see that they don’t want to repeat the mistakes that have happened elsewhere.</p>



<p>Here in Kenya we have a huge opportunity for geothermal but we are also pursing coal production. The Kenyan Government says they want to deal with climate change, but they also want to pursue cheap power because they see that as the model from countries that have industrialised. The people most badly affected by climate change are those in poor countries like Kenya. It is already affecting us with cyclones like the one in Mozambique the other day. It hits us hardest.</p>



<p>We need people in the UK to deal with climate change for themselves. When they do that they are doing it for the whole world. They can be an example for other countries and raise awareness that there is another path.</p>



<p>The Government in Kenya is going towards industrialisation, following the same model. We shouldn’t be making the same problem that you have been making.</p>



<p>What has made people to block the roads in London? The fact that nobody is listening.<br>Nobody caring. The majority of people feel that climate change is a price to pay for getting a living. And majorly people don’t want to think further.<br><br>Can we get our livelihoods without harming the world?</p>



<p>Blockades or whatever bring that discussion out. It’s in good faith. While most don’t want to take that step, these blockades bring the issue out that we need to address.</p>



<p>The economic growth model lies to people that it is dealing with climate change. In Kenya people are told to plant trees as if that was dealing with the cause of climate change, when it isn’t. The biggest cause is fossil fuels. In Kenya it’s not politically correct to speak about fossil fuels. Kenya is developing its oil industry. We are not saying the truth. We say we are dealing with climate change, at the same time we are developing our oil industry. You have to make a choice, otherwise you are not taking it seriously.</p>



<p>For us [the Ogiek forest people of Mt Elgon] climate change has been the excuse for dispossession. The community has not in any way contributed to the destruction of the forests or to climate change, but our communities are being sacrificed for proposed solutions that are not solutions. Climate change is being used as an excuse for the dispossession of forest communities who have protected their lands since time immemorial.<br> </p>



<p>The Government are getting two for one:<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>1. They are using the excuse of climate change to justify dispossessing communities, pretending that by dispossessing us they are protecting the forests, and</p>



<p>2. This means they can pretend they are doing something about climate change while pursing oil.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The same forces benefit from both. They profit from taking control of communities’ forests, and profit from cheap coal, and they do nothing to change the model that is driving climate destruction.<br> Those who know the consequences of climate destruction feel it very personally, even though the consequences are for everyone. When our land is being taken from us and destroyed we feel it very personally, even if in protecting our lands we are protecting it not only for ourselves but for everybody.<br> </p>



<p>You are fighting for something that matters hugely to you personally, but you are doing it both for yourself and others. You know that if you don’t act you will bear the consequences. You know that we will all bear the consequences. You don’t have a choice. What you guys are doing is fighting for us all for our tomorrow.</p>



<p>People here can have no clue that the climate destruction here is being caused by what is happening on the other side of the world. We need to become aware of the link between floods and droughts here and the causes of climate change there. We have a huge problem of poverty. People are told that if we exploit oil it will end poverty, but it doesn’t. The money is captured by a few, and meanwhile the climate is destroyed and ordinary people suffer.<br><br>As people here become aware we can link our struggle with yours.</p>

<p><em><strong>Vishwam Heckert explores how we move beyond empire and imperialism, abstraction and disconnection: “&#8230;if we wish to transform our world, we cannot do so without unlearning the embodied and psychic habit of separating ‘us’ and ‘them’ or ‘me’ from the ‘world’.”</strong></em></p>



<p>You do not have to be good.<br>You do not have to walk on your knees<br>for a hundred miles through the desert repenting.<br>You only have to let the soft animal of your body<br>love what it loves.</p>



<p>– Mary Oliver, Wild Geese</p>



<p>Sitting in the garden here in Cupar, drinking in this late September warmth, a familiar sound draws my gaze to the flight path above – not of aeroplanes, but wild geese wending their way south for winter. I love their dynamically shifting V-formations, supporting each other in their long journey home. The way they listen to the wind with their wings, following the flow that guides them on their way, makes my heart sing.</p>



<p>I’m also inspired to remember that the ancient ancestors of these beautiful geese also faced extinction. Rather than disappearing as we once thought, we now know that some of the dinosaurs found their wings. They adapted to changing conditions, discovering hidden depths of capacity within themselves.</p>



<p>In these times, there is little doubt that once again the Earth is calling on us all to evolve – to find new forms for living together. And we can see this isn’t easy. Change seems to bring fear and resistance. That is to be expected.</p>



<p>The secret of flight seems to lie in becoming empty. Even the bones of birds are hollow, giving them lift.</p>



<p>~~~</p>



<p>We might see ourselves as children of empire, either rebelling against or obedient to (two sides of the same coin) a <em>belief</em> that a particular way of living is advanced, superior, and unquestionably right. We might see how this pattern becomes embodied in our movements, our emotional responses, and our ways of thinking. And yet, somehow its grasp is never complete.</p>



<p>For before, during, and after empire, here is the Earth. We are first and foremost of the Earth and anything we have learned from empire, we can unlearn. Not simply with our intellect but with our whole being. In unlearning, we allow ourselves to evolve. Not by force, not by strategy, not by grandeur, but through gentleness, simplicity, and community.</p>



<p>This transformation of our culture is so critical, it can’t be rushed. Instead, we might honour the value and power of gentleness, of slowing down and of allowing ourselves to be transformed from within by the power of life itself. This inner transformation seems to be essential to the outer cultural shift we are all desperately hoping for.</p>



<p>The wing muscles of the wild geese are strong, it’s true. But it’s the sensitivity of the feathers that lets them follow the wind. It’s the humility of their hearts that allows them to take turns leading. No one is in front in order to impress the others, but to support them just as that one has been supported by the others.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="716" height="1024" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1024-1464-716x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9585" srcset="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1024-1464-716x1024.jpg 716w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1024-1464-210x300.jpg 210w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1024-1464-768x1098.jpg 768w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1024-1464-585x836.jpg 585w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1024-1464-100x143.jpg 100w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1024-1464.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 716px) 100vw, 716px" /></figure>



<p>Disconnection is both the root and the fruit of empire. There can be no hierarchy without separation, no ‘other’ to conquer and control. For anyone to draw lines on a map or between kinds of people, effectively declaring some lives are more important than others relies on the <em>imagination</em> that Life is fragmented, that the Earth is not a singular being. Of course, we each have our own wonderful and distinctive way of being in the world. Life is beautifully diverse. And it is all deeply connected.</p>



<p>When viewed through the lens of empire, life seems to be distorted. Even the teachings of the nice young man 2,000 years ago who said simply “love each other” somehow became justification for Crusades and sectarian violence when translated through the world-view of the Roman Empire. If we wish to transform our world, we cannot do so without unlearning the embodied and psychic habit of separating ‘us’ and ‘them’ or ‘me’ from the ‘world’.</p>



<p>We might now choose to replace the word empire with trauma and see how it still makes sense. Empire seems abstract, maybe distant. Trauma is intimate and embodied. But the patterns are the same. Empire is both cause and result of intergenerational trauma. My Oglala Lakota relative Edwina Brown Bull of Pine Ridge Reservation speaks powerfully of this when she talks of the history of boarding schools for indigenous people as part of the genocidal policies of the US (and Canadian) governments which we are hearing about now in the news.</p>



<p>“It’s important to understand that Federal Indian Policy played a major role in not only dismantling who we were as a people, but the land and the boarding schools were all a part of the Federal Indian Policy that were an attempt to assimilate the indigenous people to be … [weighted pause] emotion just struck me … it was an attempt for us to be something that they wanted us to be. […] As I’m learning more about the Federal Indian Policy and the impact it had on everything – every part of our indigenous nations – the one thing I have to remind myself is that <em>they can only do to us what was already done to them</em>. So when I say that statement, I’m looking at it not from a victim standpoint but more from a place of seeing that there was trauma within them in order for those to acts to happen to us. [There was trauma at] all levels from governmental to personal – all those levels!”</p>



<p>I love her deep sense of compassion, of recognising the suffering of those she might be tempted to call an enemy. But she does not. She sees only human beings, being human. And she knows that compassion is key to all healing, all beneficial change. Including, perhaps especially, compassion for ourselves. Notice how she saw that emotion struck her while she spoke and how she embraced it with compassion before continuing. Decolonisation, we might say, is a profound process of recovery from trauma and a re-opening to the fullness, wholeness, and beauty of life.</p>



<p>A parallel trauma still exists within the elite of Scottish (and British) society where young children are separated from families and sent to boarding school. Here they are not encouraged to be who they are … but to be something that others want them to be. For empire to continue, domination must be taught. And for it to end, it must be unlearned – not just intellectually, but in our whole being. Having worked both collaboratively and therapeutically with individuals sent to such schools, I can say the effect of the trauma is palpable. And yet, there is also great beauty and resilience. I have learned so much from boarding school survivors in Scotland and among the Lakota.</p>



<p>Edwina’s insights also tie in with recent scientific research which shows the biochemical signs of trauma exist equally within those we might call perpetrators and those we might call victims. Everyone is tangled up together in the same mess and we can only come untangled together. This is not to disregard the benefits of privilege by any means, but rather to recognise that material and social privilege is not the same as emotional wellbeing and a healthy sense of place in the world.</p>



<p>We all handle trauma differently. Many of us learn to survive by thinking to ourselves “it wasn’t that bad” and focussing our attention on what we might think of as “bigger problems”. Others get very caught up in the trauma, holding it close and making it an identity. We might say we have nothing to lose but our chains, but what if our chains are how we make sense of the world?</p>



<p>When we look closely at these big questions – like decolonisation, degrowth, and decarbonisation (i.e. transforming the foundation of our whole way of life), we might see that they are made up of a whole lot of smaller questions about our every day lives. It’s not logical to say we can have a healthy, sustainable, and equitable culture in Scotland without nurturing the conditions which allow the healing of the traumas that keep us feeling disconnected in various ways. That would be a bit like trying to help an ecosystem recover without tenderly nurturing the plants and animals&#8230;</p>



<p>~~~</p>



<p>Many of the great spiritual traditions teach that to heal the wounds we carry with us and to be of greater service to humanity and our whole planet, we might choose the path of becoming empty, like wild geese. In the Oglala Lakota tradition, we see very clearly how this supports a non-capitalist way of life:</p>



<p>We are called to become hollow bones for our people and anyone else we can help, and we are not supposed to seek power for our personal use and honor. What we bones really become is the pipeline that connects Wakan-Tanka, the Helpers and the community together. This tells us the direction our curing and healing work must follow and establishes the kind of life we must lead. It also keeps us working at things that do not bring us much income. So we have to be strong and committed to stick with this, otherwise we will get very little spiritual power, and we will probably give up the curing and healing work.</p>



<p>Frank Fools Crow, Oglala Lakota Holy Man</p>



<p><br>&nbsp;Here Fools Crow describes a radical openness to life and to Spirit – to listening to what is guiding us to serve others rather than become focussed on our selves.</p>



<p>In the Christian tradition, becoming ‘hollow bones’ is called kenosis (self-emptying). Rather than seeing Jesus as an authority to be obeyed (Roman Empire translation), we might see him as a great wisdom teacher who demonstrated a mystical path of becoming empty much as Lakota, Buddhist, Yoga, and other traditions teach. When we see the word mystical, we might think it’s something airy-fairy, but this work is profoundly practical for healing the patterns of empire/trauma within and around us. Cynthia Bourgeault describes a simple three-step process inspired by his teachings sometimes called ‘The Welcoming Prayer’. First we simply observe any sensation in our body which is tight, or holding, in any way. Common areas include bottom, belly, shoulders, and jaw. Maybe you notice some areas holding now? Perhaps our usual way of operating is to try to banish anything we don’t like from our experience or just grit our teeth and bear it. This practice offers another way. Instead, we start by simply “<em>acknowledging</em> what is going on internally during a distressing physical or emotional situation, ‘<em>welcoming</em>’ it, and <em>letting it go” </em>(p172, original emphasis)<em>. </em>In other words, letting the soft animal of your body relax and embrace being present in this living moment.</p>



<p>My teacher’s teacher in Yoga, Swami Satchidananda, also advocated a kind of kenosis which he called Undoism.</p>



<p>People often ask me, “What religion are you? You talk about the Bible, Koran, Torah. Are you a Hindu?” I say, “I am not a Catholic, a Buddhist, or a Hindu, but an Undo. My religion is Undoism. We have done enough damage. We have to stop doing any more and simply undo the damage we have already done.</p>



<p>Unlearning empire, unlearning separation, unlearning identifying with categories that keep us apart … undoing the damage we have done and recognising ourselves as integral with Nature, with Life Itself. Through the practices of Yoga (including breathing, meditation, postures, awareness of the mental patterns, community and devotion to something which is greater than ourselves) or similar paths of healing and transformation, we find our sense of separation becoming thinner as we come undone.</p>



<p>In undoing or emptying, we discover a fullness, a great beauty and sense of wonderment, much as ‘degrowth’ invites us to grow in ways that aren’t just about money but are about the wholeness of life. Until we empty ourselves of our need for more, we’ll never discover the richness that we already are. Capitalism depends very much on the suppression of our connection with life, with our bodies, with our pain, and with our healing. We’re invited, instead, to distract ourselves endlessly with either working or consuming. Simply being, breathing, enjoying what life brings to us and those around us, gently undermines the structures of empire/trauma that hold us frozen in a pattern that can only lead to collapse. Instead of that road, we might instead choose the radical self-care that enables us to remember that our place here on Earth is valuable, our unique contributions needed, and our healing that is the foundation of all of that.</p>



<p>Through emptying, we find our inner world becoming quieter and more peaceful. It is only when we are quiet inside that we might really <em>listen</em>. We can listen to each other in a way that allows for real community, real healing, real transformation. We can listen to that quiet inner voice of intuitive conscience that guides us to the most helpful words and deeds. We might even find we can listen to the earth, to the trees, to other beings in ways our culture tells us is impossible. For indigenous cultures, however, it is perfectly natural to listen to the trees.</p>



<p>I too was a stranger at first in this dark dripping forest perched at the edge of the sea, but I sought out an elder, my Sitka Spruce grandmother with a lap wide enough for many grandchildren. I introduced myself, told her my name and why I had come. I offered her tobacco from my pouch and asked if I might visit in her community for a time. She asked me to sit down, and there was a place right between her roots.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, modern science is only just beginning to see how much the trees speak to each other. As we all evolved together, made of the same stuff, is it so hard to imagine that we might also listen to the trees and they to us? If we wish to develop a sustainable way of life, listening to the teachings of indigenous people (including the folk wisdom and old tales of our own indigenous ancestors here in Scotland) and finding our own direct connection with the land around us is invaluable.</p>



<p>~~~</p>



<p>Through individual and collective practices of healing, our relationships are transformed: with ourselves, each other, the land, and whatever word we might like to use for the Infinite. The great anarchist Gustav Landauer pointed to this as the essence of revolution, for no institution is a transcendental being, above and beyond every day life. “The state”, he wrote, “is a social relationship; a certain way of people relating to one another. It can be destroyed by creating new social relationships; i.e., by people relating to one another differently.” Following indigenous teachings and great eco-mystics like Mary Oliver, Kathleen Jamie, Nan Shepard, and John Muir, we might expand this to include our relationships with trees and mountains, with earthworms and songbirds, with healing herbs and clear running waters.</p>



<p>We might look to the inspiring radical herbal health project known as Grass Roots Remedies. They are a workers’ cooperative, inspired by Permaculture principles, who are organically growing, harvesting, preparing, and distributing herbal medicine through public outreach projects, online sales, shops, and at their low-cost herbal clinics in Wester Hailes and Granton. The team focus on plants that grow wild in Scotland, rather than importing herbs which may be endangered by over-harvesting, and teach self-care through earth connection, just as indigenous cultures (including in Scotland) have always done.</p>



<p>We are also blessed in Scotland to host a number of forest gardens, which demonstrate a very different relationship with land than we see in most domesticated home gardens or in industrial agriculture. Some are inspired by permaculture principals – including Graham Bell and Nancy Woodhead’s ‘Garden Cottage’ in Coldream, Euan Sutherland’s ‘Rowan Refuge’ in Glasgow, or Alan Carter’s forest garden allotment in Aberdeen. Meanwhile, Rosa Steppanova and James MacKenzie’s ‘impossible garden’ in Shetland is inspired by her memories of growing up in the Black Forest and their shared passion for wildlife, beauty, and ecological diversity. Back in the Borders, Bird Gardens Scotland is reforesting and hosting programmes for conservation breeding of rare species of wild and domesticated birds. These gardens produce tremendous yields not only in terms of foodstuffs (Graham and Nancy regularly harvest 1.25 tons of food in a year on a fifth of an acre) but in space for wildlife to thrive and for human visitors to be inspired by what is possible with care, planning, and a love of nature.</p>



<p>If we wish to continue the thread of this essay in taking inspiration from indigenous cultures, we might look also to the Landback movement in North America and elsewhere to return land to indigenous stewardship and collective liberation. While the Scottish government’s support for community buyouts is laudable, we might like to set our sights on deeper transformation as we collectively consider the opportunities provided by Scottish independence. We might ask, what could Landback look like here?</p>



<p>Maybe we don’t need to know what the future holds, but simply to focus on deepening our connection with the Earth, with Life, and supporting each other to find our wings. Let’s see how we fly!</p>

<p><strong><em>Territorial struggle and prefigurative politics were evident at the Pollok Free State in the 1990s, opening up new possibilities beyond protest.

<p>This November, Glasgow will be hosting the 26<sup>th</sup> United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) meeting – or Conference of Parties (COP 26). Previous COP meetings over the past 25 years have yielded few enforceable agreements, while greenhouse gas emissions have soared globally, precipitating climate breakdown.</p>



<p>The COP26 meeting in Glasgow comes at a critical time given the accentuation of the climate emergency across the world. In this year alone, we have witnessed the lethal and destructive power of wild fires across the Western United States, Siberia, Greece, Turkey, and Italy; floods in China, Australia, Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands; record winter storms in Spain and the US; hurricane, cyclone, and large storm impacts in the US, Fiji, Indonesia, and the UK; and dust storms in China.</p>



<p>While government negotiators will meet in Glasgow sequestered from the general public, protestors from around the world will congregate in the city to demand climate justice. Climate justice foregrounds how participation and accountability can come into conversation with the need for sustainability and social justice. This recognises the interconnectedness of the issues underlying capitalism – namely, that ecological destruction and economic domination in the name of profits and growth, as well as racial, gender, and class oppressions, are the key drivers of social and environmental injustice.</p>



<p>Such injustices have a long and complex history of having been resisted in different ways across the planet. One form of resistance against environmental injustice and exploitation has come in the form of ‘free states’ and ‘autonomous zones’ of various kinds. Indeed, the notion of free states as spaces of autonomy, communing, and engagement has a long and rich activist history.</p>



<p>In the early 1990s, Pollok Free State was created as a protest encampment in Glasgow as part of mobilisations against the construction of the M77 motorway in the city. These in turn formed part of a broader wave of anti-roads protests that emerged in the UK during the 1990s, challenging the Tory government’s road building programme<strong>.</strong></p>



<p>Pollok Free State was an encampment of tree houses, tents, and benders (do-it-yourself dwellings) located in the Barrhead woods of Pollok Estate in the path of the projected motorway. Located south of Glasgow’s River Clyde, the Free State was sited amidst several low-income housing estates, including those of Pollok, Corkerhill, and Arden. Emerging in 1992&nbsp;out of the actions of Colin Macleod, an Earth First! activist and Pollok resident, the camp acted as a visible symbol of resistance to the motorway. It stood as a critique of the environmental damage caused by road building and an example of how people might live their lives differently, issuing its own passports as symbols of autonomy from the British state, more than four years before the Scottish parliament was inaugurated. <em>Pollok Free State </em>would go on to inspire many and for years to come, and morphed into the GalGael Trust (1) in Govan, a community organisation which Colin saw as a modern day people reclaiming the right to self-determination.</p>



<p>Free States and autonomous zones symbolically announce the act of claiming, bordering, and making space, as well as the contestation over land use. (2) The making of space in such zones involves various objectives and operations, including establishing media and communications infrastructures that provide mainstream media tents, liaisons, and activist media alongside everyday protest activities that constitute the free states as sites of social reproduction. These include legal, medical, and activist trauma support; governance infrastructures such as meeting spaces, announcement boards, decision-making policy guidelines etc.; and activities that reproduce everyday life in the camps such as dealing with food supply, cooking, shelter, sanitation, and the maintenance of communal and private space.(3)</p>



<p>In France, for example, <em>Zones a</em>&nbsp;<em>Defendre</em> (Zones of Defence, or ZADs) have emerged over the past decade at various locations across the country protesting destructive developments and calling for climate justice. One example is the <a href="https://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2018/05/06/from-paris-to-nantes-state-violence-1968-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZAD at <em>Notre-Dame-des-Landes</em> (near Nantes)</a> constructed on nearly 5,000 acres of wetlands, farmland, and hamlets to protest the construction of an airport planned by the French government in partnership with Vinci’s (the world’s largest multinational construction firm). As an integral part of their resistance, this ZAD has practiced creative alternatives to resource extraction through cultivating crop rotations of wheat and buckwheat, and establishing a textile workshop, microbrewery, and bakery. (4) As a result of the solidarity forged between local farmers and climate justice activists in their resistance to attacks by armed police and other forms of state repression, the airport was shelved in 2018.</p>



<p>More recently, in 2020, in Seattle (US), hundreds of activists, who had been demonstrating against police brutality since the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, converged on the Capital Hill neighbourhood of the city and set up a peaceful occupied protest. There, they distributed free food and medical supplies, planted community gardens, and held film screenings and workshops. The area was declared the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone and later the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP). During its brief duration, the CHOP was a police-free, self-governing utopia. A food co-op and medics’ corner were established and there were classes, lectures, speakers, poetry, live music, and huge works of art created.</p>



<p>For journalist and political theorist Raul Zibechi, the art of making space in community-based struggles potentially enables a dispersal of power from the state and capital. (5)The social relations generated comprise spaces “in which to build a new social organisation collectively, where new subjects take shape and materially and symbolically appropriate their space.” (6) In Zibechi’s view, territory is <em>the</em> crucial space in which contentious politics are fashioned, understood as both material territory (involving struggles over the access, control, use, and configuration of environmental resources such as land, soil, water, biodiversity, as well as the physical territory of communities, infrastructure, etc.) and immaterial territory (involving struggles over ideas, knowledges, beliefs, conceptions of the world, etc.). (7) For indigenous peoples, inclusive of the relationship to their land and communities, territorial struggles comprise resistance to the theft of land and other resources and the appropriation by capital and the state of indigenous sovereignty. (8)</p>



<p>Such ‘territorial’ struggles are conceptualised by Zibechi as “societies in movement”, defined through their creation of social relations of autonomy characterised by the (re)appropriation of resources, increased potentials for co-operation and transversal connection, the generation of new types of knowledge and capacities that facilitate self-organisation, and more horizontalist (i.e. non-hierarchical) organisational forms. (9) Many of these characteristics have been termed forms of ‘prefigurative politics’ (i.e. living now the future that is desired). The spaces they make represent ‘commons’ – resources that are collectively owned or shared between people and the relational power generated by folk acting and being-in-common. (10)</p>



<p>Making and creating space is also about articulating the symbolic significance of particular spaces and the protests that take place within them. Practices of prefigurative politics, or ‘societies in movement’, symbolise the disruption of and a resistance to neoliberal capital accumulation and the attendant climate breakdown, articulating alternatives to the status quo.</p>



<p>In our age of climate emergency, all struggles for climate justice become prefigurative territorial struggles in one way or another. For example, struggles by farmers’ movements in the majority world for food sovereignty (i.e. farmers’ control over the means of environmentally sustainable and culturally appropriate food production) take claiming and/or defence of land as a starting point for struggle. Struggles for community-owned energy renewables require a territorial basis for the siting and production of that energy, such as with the<em> Energiewende</em> (energy transition) in Germany. (11)</p>



<p>Many of the characteristics outlined above – including territorial struggle and prefigurative politics – were evident at the <em>Pollok Free State </em>in the 1990s. The act of declaring a free state opened up new possibilities beyond protest: new imaginaries, new forms of discourse. It was undoubtedly a site of social reproduction – something that is still true of GalGael today. As COP convenes for a 26th occasion, and as GalGael prepare to celebrate our 25th year, we could not escape the irony in the convention landing a few blocks away from our workshop. With UN and UK law poised to displace Scots law in the Blue and Green zones for the duration of COP, we thought it fitting to mark the occasion by declaring independence anew, with a <a href="http://www.govanfreestate.scot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Govan Free State.</a></p>



<p>Colin Macleod would come to describe Pollok Free State as a leading question, asking “Where is our democracy? Where is our parliament?” (12) Much has taken place in the past 25 years, but too little has changed. <a href="http://www.govanfreestate.scot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Govan Free State</a> will pose similar critical questions about power and political imagination in the face of climate collapse – questions set alight by the winds of wildfires and a global pandemic. We want to divest of our faith in the instruments and institutions that seem unable to respond adequately, while acknowledging the many people with tender intentions caught up in these mechanics. We will look to constitute a ’convergence space’ (13) of community members, activists, ideas, dialogue, and creativity, where folks will articulate together shared concerns and collective visions to generate a politics of solidarity founded on common ground.</p>



<p>A Govan Declaration of Independence, framed by a critical understanding of interdependence and radical dependence, will bring a wholly different aspect to the multitude of grassroots initiatives taking place in the city. Through it, we will playfully explore the notion of nations and states, alongside what it means to be a people of plural heritages. We want to explore practices to reclaim responsibility for the contested territories of our collective futures. The statement “<em>declare yourself welcome</em>” will define the borders of our territories. We’ll print and issue our own passports and make our own ceremonial ‘objects of state’. We’ll also invite others to declare their own Free States and hope to launch a downloadable <em>Declare Yourself A Free State </em>pack, a template for a constellation of distributed Free States. This is an invitation to “decolonise yersel” – be that your bedroom, your tenement close, your street, your community garden, however you might choose to define your territory – in a declaration of hope, of intent, of solidarity to counter fatalism and fire radical imagination.</p>

<p>Here in Govan, in the midst of an existence wrought with inter-generational trauma and unprocessed pain, we will gather ourselves and our practices of collective grieving – needed now more than ever as climate catastrophes coalesce. In the face of so many false solutions and uncertainty, we hope to create experiences of quiet, depth, and meaning so as to process harsh realities and draw strength.</p>



<p>Our <a href="http://www.govanfreestate.scot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Govan Free State</a> gatherings will also reclaim cultural inheritances and remember our own traditions, folklore, songs. Inspired by thinkers such as Hamish Henderson his ‘Freedom Come-All-Ye’ (14) and evoking the tradition of hospitality, the Free State will breathe life into discourse centred on our emancipation, independence, and international reconciliation through shared space, food, and music.</p>



<p>We note that COP26 starts near the time of All Hallows, All Saints, and the much older <em>Samhai</em>n – a Gaelic liminal or threshold festival marking the end of the four quarters of the Celtic year. It is a seasonal time of waning light and of passing over, a time for the death of old systems – and perhaps the birth of new worlds? We will also invoke older laws and traditional practices from the Althing (assembly fields) of Iceland or the Udal Law of Shetland and Orkney or, closer, from the ancient law mound of Doomster Hill here in Govan. We will make oaths to wild places, dying species, and more climate vulnerable communities and peoples. And we will explore with curiosity traditional forms of gathering and place-making, such as the ancient practice of the <em>aonach</em>, or great assembly.</p>



<p>By reclaiming territories, material and immaterial, we seek to stand with other indigenous peoples globally and all those left vulnerable, marginalised, or brutalised by the growing extremities of wealth and weather or many other forms of violence. Our hope is that the Free State will extend a gesture ‘beyond itself’ (15) and even beyond Glasgow. Such spaces consist of a series of spatially distributed acts and processes: those physically present are always part of more spatially extensive virtual and digital networks of support and organisation.</p>



<p>Political activities of alliance can open up the political order for challenge, through visible, embodied acts of resistance. Alliance building for climate justice must also invent ways of saying, seeing, and being, that nurture a politics of affinity, and that engender new forms of collective and inclusive enunciation, engendering new subjects for the uncertain futures that await us all.</p>

			<p>Last summer everything seemed to come together. System failure surrounds us. Capitalism is facing a physical crisis that can’t be ignored.

			<p>So suggests a new report commissioned by a group of scientists appointed by the UN Secretary-General. The main reason?:</p>
<p>“We’re transitioning rapidly to a radically different global economy, due to our increasingly unsustainable exploitation of the planet’s environmental resources.</p>
<p>Climate change and species extinctions are accelerating even as societies are experiencing rising inequality, unemployment, slow economic growth, rising debt levels, and impotent governments. Contrary to the way policymakers usually think about these problems, the new report says that these are not really separate crises at all.</p>
<p>Rather, these crises are part of the same fundamental transition to a new era characterized by inefficient fossil fuel production and the escalating costs of climate change. Conventional capitalist economic thinking can no longer explain, predict, or solve the workings of the global economy in this new age, the paper says.”</p>
<p>It may be mundane but the reality is that Energy Return on Investment (EROI) – a simple ratio that measures how much energy we use to extract more energy – may be presenting the endgame for the fossil fuel economy that lies beneath western economics.</p>
<p>The timeline between our diminishing finite fuel resources, and our inability to transition to a low-carbon economy has been a dance between political intransigence, consumer duplicity and corporate greenwashing.</p>
<p>In a new book published by Pluto this month Simon Pirani explains the contradictions and roots of the crisis in <a title="" href="https://www.plutobooks.com/blog/truth-fight-against-fossil-fuels/?preview=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.plutobooks.com/blog/truth-fight-against-fossil-fuels/?preview%3Dtrue&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1536684762631000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGiTcrdYpRa3_MvX4_V7Sh33dC6ow">“The Truth about the Fight Against Fossil Fuels”:</a></p>
<p>“When politicians and diplomats meet in Katowice, Poland, in December for the 2018 round of international climate negotiations, they will not even pretend to aim at cutting greenhouse gas emissions – mostly from burning fossil fuels – far enough to prevent dangerous climate change.<br />
The negotiators’ modest aim is to leave Katowice with an agreed procedure for monitoring implementation of promises that countries made to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions at the Paris climate conference in 2015.</p>
<p>Even if all the governments involved keep all their promises (like that has ever happened!), we are heading by 2100 for global average temperatures 2.6 degrees above the pre-industrial level. The Paris agreement itself said that margin should be ‘well below’ 2 degrees, and that countries would ‘endeavour’ to keep it to 1.5 degrees.”</p>

			<p>As Pirani explains:</p>
<p>“The failure in Paris to make the climate arithmetic add up was the culmination of decades of failure by the world’s leading states to slow down, let alone reverse, consumption growth of fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) – which is the source of about three quarters of all human-made greenhouse gases.</p>
<p>Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels in 2017 were 56% higher than they were in 1992, a quarter century earlier, when the first international agreement to tackle climate change was made at the Rio summit.”</p>
<p>That’s an incredible fact which speaks to a global failure.</p>

			<p>Now, for the first time experts have calculated the precise figure of carbon Scotland can (and cannot) produce to keep in accord with the Paris agreement <a href="http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/16599722.experts-call-for-north-sea-oil-closure-to-cut-climate-pollution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/16599722.experts-call-for-north-sea-oil-closure-to-cut-climate-pollution/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1536684762631000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEPsDBUEh84yM22O-mFg1ZwbzIxfw">“Experts call for North Sea oil closure to cut climate pollution”.</a></p>

<p><strong>On Leadership and Change</strong></p>
<div id="m_-8272684001777254592m_-4504758609523762666subscription-content">
<p>The Herald reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>
“For the first time the scientists worked out Scotland’s carbon budget under the international climate agreement made in Paris in 2015. They conclude that for Scotland to meet its global responsibilities it can only emit a total of 300 million tonnes more carbon dioxide – meaning it has to cut emissions by at least ten per cent every year starting now.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>The report points out that if the world is to meet international climate targets 70-80 per cent of known fossil fuel reserves must stay in the ground. “Scotland needs to begin an urgent and phased closure of its oil and gas sector,” it says.</p>
<p>Now this is going to cause some problems.</p>
<p>No-one really wants to do anything, even though the overwhelming evidence is that the world is teetering on the brink of catastrophic change.</p>
<p>Real courageous leadership is conspicuous by its absence.</p>
<p>No-one wants to give up the lifestyle they’ve assumed is their right.</p>
<p>At either end of income scale in developed countries there’s little appetite for change.</p>
<p>Many of the wealthiest people have made their money from resource exploitation and can’t see beyond it.</p>
<p>Many people suffering in poverty don’t see how this ‘crisis’ is to do with them or how they might have agency to change such a reality.</p>
<p>Many people who want to see an independent Scotland are still obsessed by the “It’s Scotland’s Oil” trope of the 1970s. Many will no doubt claim that “it will make no difference” and we should use every last drop.</p>
<p>I fully expect this column to be flooded by such comments afterwards.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not Scotland’s oil, its Shell’s Exxon’s and BP’s. And yes we could tax them and yes we could create an Oil Fund – but we would be doing so at least thirty years too late. Other emerging industries, and non-industries have far more potential and far less destructive impact.</p>
<p>We need to stop being obsessed with oil.</p>
<p>We need to abandon fossil fuels.</p>
<p>We have most of the technology in place and we are remarkably blessed with tidal, wave, wind and hydro capacity.</p>
<p>It’s a weird space to be in where the climate deniers are us, even in the face of overwhelming crisis, changing weather patterns and extinctions.</p>
<p>The report is scarily precise, naming companies and attributing specific emissions to each of them. We can close them down, we can find alternative employment, but we won’t, not just out of the exertion of corporate power, but out of our own complicity, cowardice and inertia.</p>
<p>That’s how this ends, by us doing nothing at all.</p>
