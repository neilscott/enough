<p><strong>Poem by Juana Adcock. Illustration: Fadzai Mwakutuya; photo: Ewan Bush</strong></p>



<p>This is from #2 of LESS &#8211; our journal of degrowth, radical sufficiency and decolonisation in Scotland. <a href="https://www.enough.scot/less/">Details of how to get a print copy here.</a></p>



<p></p>



<p><em><u>Steel</u></em></p>



<p>I place my palm en la reja called border wall.</p>



<p>Let its steel enter my body: iron alloyed with carbon</p>



<p>hardened to prevent the<em> movement of</em> <em>dislocations.</em></p>



<p>I am in Tijuana, looking at California through the bars</p>



<p>though it isn’t clear where the prison lies.</p>



<p>To my left the bars peter out into an ocean</p>



<p>whose waves refuse to be contained.</p>



<p>The body of an adult human</p>



<p>contains about four grams of iron;</p>



<p>all four of mine rush to meet la reja imantada.</p>



<p>When we speak of magnetism,</p>



<p>we think of love, or charisma,</p>



<p>or crowds of faces all in one direction.</p>



<p>But never of iron as the metal</p>



<p>at the active site of many enzymes</p>



<p>dealing with cellular respiration</p>



<p>or the pull towards a ‘better life’.</p>



<p>Glasgow’s sandstone tenements, incidentally,</p>



<p>are red because they contain iron.</p>



<p>Our blood stone is iron ore.</p>



<p>It emanates its own light.</p>



<p>We are the blood, migrating</p>



<p>bringing cargo</p>



<p>from one cell to the next</p>



<p>keeping the body alive, we transport</p>



<p>mercancía</p>



<p>maquinaria</p>



<p>manos</p>



<p>más.</p>



<p>The iron for the wall was mined in the M states</p>



<p>bordering with Canada.</p>



<p>Not that long ago, the land was cleared</p>



<p>of its people, wildlife and forests.</p>



<p>Migrants from Europe fed the logs down the rivers</p>



<p>laid the train tracks</p>



<p>peeled away life on the topsoil</p>



<p>bloodlet the earth to build</p>



<p>this line of steel</p>



<p>marking the limits of possession.</p>



<p>Praying from Carnegie’s <em>Gospel of Wealth</em></p>



<p>which built an empire of steel</p>



<p>repeating that this was progress</p>



<p>away from universal squalor</p>



<p>we were able to steal our eyes away</p>



<p>from the impoverishment</p>



<p>of the lands</p>



<p>—now empty red pits</p>



<p>gaping red wounds</p>



<p>as far as the eye can see.</p>



<p></p>



<p><em><u>The Letter M</u></em></p>



<p>With a guru’s moustache and a penchant for conspiracy</p>



<p>the madman explains to me that language is a form of mind control</p>



<p>the grammar itself holding us in a bind</p>



<p>– an incantation muttered over millenia</p>



<p>shaping our thoughts.</p>



<p>I want to master the art of the pictogram, he says.</p>



<p>It is the earliest form of writing</p>



<p>is uncontaminated by the misers, the drive for accumulation</p>



<p>created with the rise of agriculture.</p>



<p>The letter M, for example, is the pictogram of a wave</p>



<p>we forget where it comes from, it loses all meaning</p>



<p>we write it over and over without ever thinking of water</p>



<p>or how maritime and motherly,</p>



<p>muro y morada are of one essence.</p>



<p>As he speaks, I watch the surfers glide along the lip of the perfect breakers</p>



<p>almost for the whole line of the horizon</p>



<p>before they topple over into the sea</p>



<p>like tiny plastic soldiers.</p>



<p>That night we slept hearing the waves crash onto the rocks</p>



<p>and in the morning, we knew we were rocks too.</p>



<p>Our hearts, hardened lava.</p>



<p>The Pacific had smoothed round windows through us</p>



<p>and like a Barbara Hepworth sculpture</p>



<p>we were made whole</p>



<p>by what we lack.</p>



<p></p>



<p><em><u>Storylines</u></em></p>



<p>Roads are heavier on the rich side of the line.</p>



<p>Asphalt mixed with cement is whiter</p>



<p>loudening under car wheels, it hardens over time,</p>



<p>requiring little maintenance.</p>



<p>Such are the roads of the first world.</p>



<p>But the dwellings there are transient</p>



<p>wooden-framed and lighter</p>



<p>as if to be filled with</p>



<p>cushions and the crinkle of food wrappers</p>



<p>and some child’s quiet voice in a corner of the room</p>



<p>mouthing</p>



<p>and I’ll huff</p>



<p>and I’ll puff.</p>



<p>On the other side of the line</p>



<p>the asphalt grows crocodile-skinned.</p>



<p>Pockmarked and permeable,</p>



<p>it can cope with earthquakes</p>



<p>and melt in the sun.</p>



<p>Initially it’s cheaper to lay</p>



<p>but has a shorter lifespan.</p>



<p>Such the roads of the third world.</p>



<p>But here, our houses</p>



<p>you can tell by just looking at them</p>



<p>are made of cement, heavy as pyramids</p>



<p>as if to hold us at home</p>



<p>for longer.</p>



<p></p>

<p><strong>Meticulous the Gardener by Tawona Ganyamatopé Sitholé</strong></p>



<p>that plant is a weed</p>



<p></p>



<p>meticulous the gardener</p>



<p>decides with no hesitation</p>



<p>growing where it shouldn&#8217;t</p>



<p>so of kukosha</p>



<p>having none</p>



<p>so here come</p>



<p>necessary tools for necessary</p>



<p>hacking</p>



<p>hacking</p>



<p>digging</p>



<p>digging</p>



<p>that plant</p>



<p>of a thriving population</p>



<p>born of wind pollination</p>



<p>grounded such thing</p>



<p>earthed by totem being</p>



<p>a weed for weeding</p>



<p>and to do it properly</p>



<p>have to pull from the roots</p>



<p>and that&#8217;s the land cleared</p>



<p></p>



<p>this plant is a plant</p>



<p></p>



<p>meticulous the gardener</p>



<p>knows with no investigation</p>



<p>growing there it should</p>



<p>and of kukosha</p>



<p>having tonnes</p>



<p>so here come</p>



<p>necessary tools for necessary</p>



<p>tending</p>



<p>tending</p>



<p>fencing</p>



<p>fencing</p>



<p>this plant</p>



<p>of promising signs</p>



<p>born of meticulous design</p>



<p>founded such thing</p>



<p>birthed by human being</p>



<p>a plant for planting</p>



<p>and to do it properly</p>



<p>have to pool from the youth</p>



<p>and that&#8217;s the land developed</p>



<p></p>



<p>this plant that is rooted not in soil</p>



<p></p>



<p>this plant that stems not from seed</p>



<p>this plant that branches not for light</p>



<p>this seedling that is not a sibling</p>



<p>of scattered fellow earthlings</p>



<p>although raw materials will be ripening as it grows<br><br>so is this then what develop meant</p>



<p><br>this plant that does not dance in the wind</p>



<p>this plant that does not drink in the rain</p>



<p>this plant that does not eat in the sun</p>



<p>this plant that does not</p>



<p>catch brushstrokes of the seasons</p>



<p>although raw materials will be ripening as it grows<br><br>so is this then what develop meant</p>



<p><br>this plant that is not</p>



<p>a free and open source</p>



<p>no nourish flourish lively lush</p>



<p>just fizzy dizzy busy buzz</p>



<p>of worker drones</p>



<p>striving in dependence of this growth</p>



<p>expansionextensionextensionexpansion</p>



<p>expansionextensionextensionexpansion</p>



<p>playing on repeat</p>



<p>like songs</p>



<p>mighty mighty songs</p>



<p>of revolution</p>



<p>with a dreamy melody</p>



<p>sung from lips not from heart</p>



<p>by growth wishers shedding skin</p>



<p>for eeky strangers within</p>



<p>haplessly knocking shins</p>



<p>in a graceless jig</p>



<p>going</p>

<p>villainvictimvillainvictim</p>



<p>in this graceless jig<br></p>



<p>the day is done</p>



<p><br>meticulous the gardener</p>



<p>declares with no reservation</p>



<p>after an industrious time</p>



<p>a’counting ripe materials</p>



<p>and of kukosha</p>



<p>who can say</p>



<p>earth is earth</p>



<p>nature is nature</p>



<p>a plant is a plant</p>



<p>hmmm</p>



<p>a human being is something else</p>
