	<description>Enough! is an informal collective of activists in Scotland who have come together to take action on challenging our dominant economic system. We believe that inequality, oppression, injustice, power and ecological breakdown are all connected by the same story:</description>

Hosted by Enough!&#8217;s layla-roxanne, Jem and Gehan will discuss the core themes of the Deep Adaptation agenda &#8211; resilience, relinquishment and restoration &#8211; with a view to social, environmental and racial justice, grounded in a Scottish and global context.</p>

<p><strong>Professor Jem Bendell</strong> originated the concept of Deep Adaptation to help people  explore individual and collective responses to the future collapse of  society due to climate chaos. His research paper on the topic has been  downloaded over half a million times and is widely credited with  influencing the founders of the Extinction Rebellion protest movement,  which Professor Bendell advises. An author of many books, papers and UN  reports on aspects of sustainable development, Bendell now focuses on  supporting people from various professions to explore our challenging  predicament. In particular, through the free Deep Adaptation Forum &#8211; <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.deepadaptation.info/" target="_blank">www.deepadaptation.info</a></p>

<p><strong>Gehan Macleod</strong> comes from a 90s background in environmental and  anti-nuclear activism &#8211; which lead to her involvement in co-founding the  GalGael Trust, an organisation that originated around a protest fire at  Pollok  Free State, an anti motorway camp. Growing tired of being  anti-stuff &#8211;  for the last twenty years, she’s been caught up with being  for-stuff at&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.galgael.org" target="_blank">GalGael</a>&nbsp;&#8211;   a working community based in Glasgow that makes, decides and learns   together. She’s kind of had it with rearranging-deck-chairs-on-the-Titanic kind of change and, so for now she collects and hoards half-formed notions that suggest a more effective use of energy in the face of all that is going down. This  includes: approaches informed by solidarity and love; systems thinking;  pondering the nature of power; or exploring countercultural and  prefigurative ways of organising that dismantle old norms and prototype  new narratives… ways that will perpetuate the culture shift needed.&nbsp;@gehan_macleod</p>

<p><strong>The aftercare bit:</strong> The Deep Adaptation framework suggests that societal collapse happens through climate breakdown. Some people may find this a difficult conversation. There will be a chance to spend time together after the event at the <a href="https://www.clydebuiltfestival.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clydebuilt Festival</a>, and we will point out existing support groups for follow-up conversations. </p>
