<p><strong>Professor Jem Bendell</strong> originated the concept of Deep Adaptation to help people  explore individual and collective responses to the future collapse of  society due to climate chaos. His research paper on the topic has been  downloaded over half a million times and is widely credited with  influencing the founders of the Extinction Rebellion protest movement,  which Professor Bendell advises. An author of many books, papers and UN  reports on aspects of sustainable development, Bendell now focuses on  supporting people from various professions to explore our challenging  predicament. In particular, through the free Deep Adaptation Forum &#8211; <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.deepadaptation.info/" target="_blank">www.deepadaptation.info</a></p>

<p><strong>Gehan Macleod</strong> comes from a 90s background in environmental and  anti-nuclear activism &#8211; which lead to her involvement in co-founding the  GalGael Trust, an organisation that originated around a protest fire at  Pollok  Free State, an anti motorway camp. Growing tired of being  anti-stuff &#8211;  for the last twenty years, she’s been caught up with being  for-stuff at&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.galgael.org" target="_blank">GalGael</a>&nbsp;&#8211;   a working community based in Glasgow that makes, decides and learns   together. She’s kind of had it with rearranging-deck-chairs-on-the-Titanic kind of change and, so for now she collects and hoards half-formed notions that suggest a more effective use of energy in the face of all that is going down. This  includes: approaches informed by solidarity and love; systems thinking;  pondering the nature of power; or exploring countercultural and  prefigurative ways of organising that dismantle old norms and prototype  new narratives… ways that will perpetuate the culture shift needed.&nbsp;@gehan_macleod</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>Katherine Trebeck, author of </em><a href="https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/E/bo41907609.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Economics of Arrival</em></a><em> on why Scotland needs to embrace a de-growth agenda.</em><br><br></p>



<p>In 1983 President Reagan
declared, ‘There are&nbsp;no great limits to growth because there are no limits
to human intelligence, imagination and wonder’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That was an era when
students were striking against the risk of atomic war, when celebrities sang
that aid and charity from the west would ‘feed the world’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was a time when the
scientific community was building a strong evidence base about
hydrofluorocarbons that resulted in political agreement (the&nbsp;‘Montreal
Protocol’) to eradicate their use in order to protect the ozone layer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, some three decades
on,&nbsp;thousands and thousands of&nbsp;students&nbsp;around the
world&nbsp;are striking against the inadequate political response to the climate
crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, both celebrities and
companies are being called out for tax evasion which undermines state budgets
for health and education&nbsp;in the UK and around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the scientific community
is not only warning against the 6<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;mass extinction, it’s building an evidence base
that the link between economic growth and environmental impact is real. The
recent Global Assessment pulled no punches in saying: ‘A key constituent of
sustainable pathways is…steering away from the current limited paradigm of
economic growth’.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Only calling for our current economic system to be
decarbonised ignore such biodiversity losses. They also
ignore the evidence</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>That&nbsp;decoupling&nbsp;growth
from carbon emissions&nbsp;is a case of buying things from overseas rather than
at home (so it is recorded in another country’s carbon ledger)</li><li>That&nbsp;efficiency gains
are&nbsp;liable to&nbsp;be partially offset by&nbsp;rebound (spent on other
goods and services which themselves have a carbon footprint), and</li><li>That&nbsp;any decoupling is&nbsp;just too slow to be a
solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>This is the&nbsp;unfortunate
reality for proponents of&nbsp;a&nbsp;technological
saviour&nbsp;scenario&nbsp;or green growth (which, in a way, is the
macroeconomic equivalent of greenwashing).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Community groups and
scholars alike are also pointing to the mounting evidence that economic growth is
not an automatic contributor to equality of opportunity, despite the claims of hundreds
of economics text books and so many politicians in the UK and around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>How would such claims go
down with&nbsp;communities in Scotland who haven’t seen many drips
trickling&nbsp;their way&nbsp;from the growth in Scotland’s GDP in the decades
since Reagan was President?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>How would it sound&nbsp;to
the people who have to turn to food banks after a shift&nbsp;at
work&nbsp;because the economic activity on offer isn’t enabling them to
feed&nbsp;their families?&nbsp;</p>



<p>How would it sound to the
streets of Scotland where life expectancy is more than fifteen years below that
of the rest of the population, where amenities are&nbsp;crumbling,&nbsp;and
opportunity is restricted by deeply unequal outcomes?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And yet,&nbsp;in
spite&nbsp;of&nbsp;such&nbsp;contemporary realities, thinking from the Reagan
era lives on – on our airwaves, political debates, and even in our mindsets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just over&nbsp;12 months ago,&nbsp;a&nbsp;report
was published on behalf of the SNP&nbsp;and voted on at their&nbsp;2019&nbsp;spring
conference, the product of the “Sustainable Growth Commission”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The&nbsp;354-page document contains
some useful and progressive proposals – not least its framing&nbsp;of
tax&nbsp;as an investment and welcoming the role of migrants in Scottish
life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But
the&nbsp;very&nbsp;premise of the report has been inadequately discussed and the
critique of it thus far has focused on&nbsp;Scotland’s currency&nbsp;post-independence,
with even&nbsp;some of the currency arguments being framed&nbsp;according to
their impact on GDP&nbsp;growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Turning the pages
reveals&nbsp;that the report&nbsp;focuses on “sustainable” in the “perpetual”
sense of the term, not&nbsp;the&nbsp;“taking into account environmental limits
and so operating in a way to respect and regenerate the ecosystem” sense of the
term.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The latter doesn’t make for
such a catchy title, but the former sense&nbsp;and the agenda of the report
itself needs to be re-examined in light of scientific consensus around climate
change, youth&nbsp;outrage at political intransigence, and the failure of a
growth-orientated model to deliver for enough communities in Scotland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The&nbsp;Growth
Commission&nbsp;points to New Zealand’s economy over the last decade or so as
something to&nbsp;emulate, despite New Zealand’s concerted efforts to move away
from&nbsp;its&nbsp;recent growth-ist&nbsp;orientation and instead build a wellbeing
economy. As Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>people look [at our GDP] and&nbsp;say&nbsp;‘you’re doing
OK’. But we have homelessness at staggering rates, ones of the highest rates of
youth suicide in the OECD and our mental health and wellbeing is not what it
should be. We need to address the societal wellbeing of our nation, not just
the economic wellbeing.</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em></em></p>



<p>These words could easily
apply to Scotland.&nbsp;Instead of persisting with an economic model that our
Kiwi friends are discarding, we should accompany
them&nbsp;in&nbsp;imagining&nbsp;and creating&nbsp;an economy more suited to
the&nbsp;environmental realities of our age and which does more to ensure the
economy works for all, not just the privileged few.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And in many
respects,&nbsp;Scotland is pioneering a new way,&nbsp;recognising that our
economy can be one that is better than growth. They entail efforts to&nbsp;make
the economy circular and businesses more inclusive.&nbsp;There is cross-party
support for&nbsp;broadening the notion of national success towards a broader
set of goals via the National Performance Framework and, just recently, a shift
in the goal of Scottish Enterprise towards supporting businesses that deliver
quality jobs, wellbeing and tackling inequality.&nbsp;And Scotland&nbsp;is
showing leadership in convening the new Wellbeing Economy Governments (WEGo) initiative&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet, despite these
highlights,&nbsp;the Growth Commission sits alognside a long list
of&nbsp;examples&nbsp;that illustrate&nbsp;ubiquity of the growth-ist&nbsp;mindset.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You see it in
the&nbsp;almost ubiquitous talk of&nbsp;boosting Scotland’s productivity –
without exploration of:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>More of what (do we really
need to churn out more things?)</li><li>Without recognition&nbsp;of the
power imbalances in workplaces that so often mean productivity gains are
captured by the owners of capital, with workers making do with the crumbs, and</li><li>Without discussion as to whether faster and faster is
an appropriate goal for a post-industrial economy that could pride itself on
services, on care, on craftmanship?&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>You read about the growth-ist&nbsp;mindset each time
there is a news report that compares Scotland’s GDP to that of the UK or the
OECD, every time a financial analyst makes predictions for the Scottish economy
and all they consider are future GDP and simple employment numbers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You see it in the business
case being made for gender equality or addressing poverty (“it’s a drag on the
economy”).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And you hear the growth-ist&nbsp;mindset every time we
have a nice adjective stuck in front of
growth:&nbsp;‘inclusive’,&nbsp;‘green’,&nbsp;‘low carbon’,&nbsp;‘shared’. </p>



<p>These at least concede that
growth comes with environmental and social collateral damage.&nbsp;But these new ways of
framing growth show our collective&nbsp;mind has&nbsp;been so tuned to growth,
our imaginations so limited, that the best we can do is put an adjective in
front of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Expanding our collective imagination
to encompass the possibility and the necessity of a post-growth economy that
serves people and planet&nbsp;requires updating Reagan’s quote for the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;Century and using our
limitless imaginations, wonder, and human intelligence to build an economy that
is better than growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It means, to cite Gramsci,
massively rejigging the ‘hegemony of the common sense’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Enough! Project is a
vital much needed driver of that rejigging: multifaceted, grassroots focused, with
eyes firmly on reframing the discussion and collaboration for change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the Enough!&nbsp;framing
can be applied to the significant shifts needed in how things are discussed and
done in Scotland:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Enough adhering to a 20<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century model&nbsp;</li><li>Enough pitting environmental goals against social
justice and employment&nbsp;</li><li>Enough of being content with downstream sticking
plasters, important though they are&nbsp;</li><li>Enough tribalism when young people are deeply and
rightly concerned about their future&nbsp;</li><li>Enough chasing for more and more as the solution to
all our woes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>And enough of not
recognising that while we have enough&nbsp;resources, we certainly don’t have
enough of sharing and cherishing them.&nbsp;</p>
