<p><em>This is the first in a series of articles reflecting on the last three weeks traveling for the Enough Routes programme. <a href="https://www.enough.scot/2019/10/10/acting-out/">Gehan Macleod</a> describes time spent helping out at two expressions of migrant solidarity at Calais and Ventimiglia.</em></p>



<p><strong>Ventimiglia</strong></p>



<p>Language can be limited in situations when
people speak Arabic in many dialects; Kurdish; French; borrowed Italian,
English learned through nursery rhymes related by an earnest school teacher in
some time that is now far away. A time that must feel further away as geography
and events displace <em>now</em> from <em>then</em>, displaced you from the lands
of your home. And yet the language of emotion across a face is universal; eyes
lit by mobiles and fierce joy while on calls to loved ones &#8211; familiar faces and
tones conjured up on small screens, enough light to scatter the darkness
momentarily. Moments that chase away the shadows of despair, or past and recent
traumas that stir emotions – emotions that cannot be allowed to smother hope. </p>

<p>It is a hope that compelled those I meet at the
roadside close to the border between Italy and France, to set off and leave all
that was familiar behind with loved ones, if war or unrest hadn’t taken them. </p>



<p>Hope that new places might obliterate loss. </p>



<p>Hope that new lands might offer asylum from torment
and repression. </p>



<p>Hope that has kept them moving on. </p>



<p>Through darkness. </p>



<p>Through danger. </p>



<p>Through miles and miles of strange land, strange
towns and strange glances. </p>



<p>Through borders when chance allowed. Hope that somewhere they might find the ‘better life’ sold to them and tens of thousands of others leaning in to flickering images of the West, transmitted into homes everywhere – neoliberal ideals of success brought to life by cathode ray tubes or perhaps liquid crystal. An empty promise they have come to call <em>the big lie</em>; <em>“</em>we now know Europe is a big lie” they say. Yet they cannot afford to let these thoughts cross their brow for more than a moment. Hope is all they have left – a marker that all they’ve endured has been for some end. </p>



<p>The talk soon returns to what opportunities might lie just beyond <em>that</em> horizon and plans for how to cross it. Their chat is interspersed with stories from their journeys to get to where they’re standing now. Humorous recounting of Bond-style attempts to cross borders; along live train tracks, furtive attempts to escape capture – something to pit your wits against, to display the kind of ingenuity and perseverance rewarded in other circles. Other times experiences of hardship related with a shudder, or encounters with ruthless smugglers.</p>

<p>Language can be limited and what can I convey
that a thousand articles in a hundred publications haven’t conveyed already? The
so-called migrant crisis must have been covered by tens of thousands of words
in print and broadcasts. We know that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_migrant_crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 2015 the situation</a> has worsened. Yet <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/24/it-could-have-been-me-refugees-describe-their-journeys-to-the-uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">individual stories</a> are made and remade
every day. Small snatches of the stories of the 31 men and eight women found
dead in a container in Essex have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/24/essex-lorry-deaths-39-victims-were-chinese-nationals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made the headlines</a>. But there are many
more stories unfolding as I write this (as you read it). What can I truthfully
say to Mohammed and Mûrtha searching my face for hope, for some kind of answer?
Do I agree that there will be a good-paying job waiting for them in a UK free
from racism? Or do I risk undermining that precious hope they have? I want to
offer answers, affirm their sense of hope. I want to see some way to have hope
myself &#8211; that this situation could be overturned, if not for these guys, for
those who will otherwise come after them. But it all feels so overwhelmingly
wrong and fucked up. With no answers and no other way to feel I can do
something, I sink my arms into cauldron-like cooking pots and scrub. I sort
wood sheds. I peel carrots. I chop onions at the makeshift kitchen in the
mountains of <a href="https://keshaniya.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kesha Niya</a> – Surani Kurdish for ‘No Problem’. Here, off
their own backs, they’ve been cooking a hot meal every day for around 100
displaced people for the past few years. They are supported by <a href="https://www.roya-citoyenne.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roya Citoyenne</a>, an association that promotes “intercommunality” in nearby Roya. They
transport and serve the food about 40 minutes drive away in an unused car park in
<a href="https://www.redpepper.org.uk/the-deadly-border-politics-of-ventimiglia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ventimiglia</a>, on the Italian
Riviera. They’ve seen times when the numbers have swelled to 600 or more. The
night we are there it’s dark and around eighty guys line up next to a flyover for
a hot meal dished up by the small crew of volunteers. Others will have found
refuge in the Red Cross camp nearby, a place many will not go as entry requires
being fingerprinted; a process that can prevent applications for asylum
elsewhere in Europe.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="768" height="1024" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kesha-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8083" srcset="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kesha-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kesha-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kesha-585x780.jpg 585w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kesha-100x133.jpg 100w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kesha.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<p>About 5 miles away, by the side of the road, the
same small group offer an all-day resting place to those pushed back from the
French-Italian border, just a few hundred feet further down the road. They
offer fresh food, hot coffee and water, somewhere to charge mobiles and advice
to the 80 to 100 or more people a day who were stopped trying to walk past
police at the border. The unlucky are those detained in containers overnight and
not released until 4 p.m. the following day – without food or water. These guys
drink long from the plastic water cans balanced on a low roadside wall. Kesha
Niya have self-organised this resting place for around two years – every day
since last May. They record and compile data: where people have travelled from,
which routes they’ve taken, women or minors travelling alone, as well as
incidents of illegal or ill treatment at the border<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>.
They have seen an increase in French police turning away young adults (still
legally children), who they are supposed to guarantee protection to. They do so
by falsifying their date of birth on the papers they issue to them; dates that
are obviously false, such as 01/01/2000. They are particularly concerned about
the use of the containers. The facilities at the border do not allow for
detention &#8211; the French police are only legally supposed to detain people for
the purposes of confirming their identity. Given the recent find in Essex, this
is a particularly chilling development. The day I left, there were reportedly
30-50 guys who were detained between 3 containers arranged to form a courtyard.
Pepper spray was used and when this triggered an epileptic fit, there were only
half-hearted attempts to offer medical support, while other officers looked on
and laughed. Another man showed police his medical papers to demonstrate his
need for diabetic medication and was met with a similar response. A Moroccan
migrant captured some of this on his phone. The organisers are not hopeful
about exerting pressure that would persuade the French police to ensure they operate
within the law.</p>



<p><strong>Calais</strong></p>



<p>Many of the guys passing Ventimiglia are heading
for Calais. When I left there earlier in the week, French police were in the
process of evicting some of the sites surrounding the port, where we were told there
are currently around 700 displaced people encamped. There have been <a href="https://helprefugees.org/news/the-calais-jungle-three-years-on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 1,300 recorded evictions</a> since the
world-renowned <em>Jungle</em> was evicted in 2016 – on 24 October, exactly three
years ago the day I arrive there. There are a number of organisations there in
solidarity with existing refugees and the new migrants arriving daily. Not just
well-established NGOs but spontaneous groups like <a href="https://helprefugees.org/latest-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Help Refugees</a> and <a href="http://www.refugeecommunitykitchen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Refugee Community Kitchen</a>; citizen-led responses to the very real situation
displaced people find themselves in &#8211; a direct expression of solidarity and
mutual aid. These groups are filling gaping chasms left by European governments
whose immigration policies are woefully inadequate in response to the
challenges posed by migration. It’s not hard to see the ‘migrant crisis’, a
term worthy of critical reflection, was at least worsened, if not created by
their own foreign policies and other international interventions variously
motivated or by the climate change that has been one of the deadly costs of
Europe’s wealth.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="768" height="1024" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/thumbnail-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8084" srcset="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/thumbnail.jpg 768w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/thumbnail-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/thumbnail-585x780.jpg 585w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/thumbnail-100x133.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<p>Since 2015, RCK have been cooking and distributing 1200-1500 hot meals a day to displaced people camped around Calais and Dunkirk. It’s an effort impressive in scale and delivered with expertise and care on minimal resources. An effort made only more impressive by the self-organisation the place runs on; decisions are made collectively through daily meetings. It was there, while washing more pots and preparing veg &#8211; that I found out about the group in Ventimiglia. RCK cook from 9 a.m., distributions start mid-afternoon and they work until past 7 p.m. and like Kesha Niya, these efforts are entirely driven by volunteers, many of whom are informed, compassionate young people looking for an immediate means to make some difference in a world they’ve inherited. One young woman travels down from studying for a degree in International Relations at Edinburgh Uni to help out here. She says she can’t wait until she has graduated so she can be here longer, although she’s still trying to figure out how to support herself to do so. She says she loves meeting the people out on distribution; getting to know familiar faces but she also mentions how the self-organising works for her. It seems the streamlined operation is the result of many people’s expertise and creativity &#8211; problem solving together to make things flow more smoothly. </p>



<p>She feels her contributions are not only welcome but useful. They were also able to absorb significant numbers of new volunteers and very quickly have them on a useful task. Here people are working long hours for no pay and the atmosphere borders on festival-like at times; loud tunes pump out and a disco light pulsates over the huge pots of curry cooking. It’s also clear that a ton of relevant expertise has landed and informed the running of the place in ways that just make sense – I’m there during the weekly deep clean that would put a professional kitchen to shame. I mention this as there’s something that strikes me that relates to John Holloway’s ‘doing’ as distinct from alienated labour<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> and Illich’s autonomous action that are important in <em>acting out</em>, of finding ways to degrow and regrow, of adapting to crisis. </p>



<p><strong>Language of limits</strong></p>



<p>When I was packing, I grabbed a couple of thin books to keep baggage down. One was Illich’s <em>Right to Useful Unemployment</em>. Somehow whenever I open Illich I find something that hits the nail squarely on the head. Crisis, he says, has become an indicator that experts must step in while normal liberties are suspended &#8211; a perversion from Greek roots that suggested ‘choices’ or ‘turning points’. He insists it could mean “the marvellous moment when people suddenly become aware of their self-imposed cages and the possibility of a different life.” Michael Dunn’s description of the migrant crisis as <a href="https://edgeryders.eu/t/mobile-independent-clinic/827" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a training ground</a> for other forms of crisis, was the first time I’d come across this perspective. At both Calais and Ventimiglia this was evident. In the face of unimaginable precarity and risk, it was impossible not be to impressed and deeply moved by the quiet dignity of the guys I met, whose grasp on hope and a heavy sense of humour kept them going. Those who’ve left all that is familiar in the hope of safety from oppression, war or unrest or simply a better way of life – have something massive to teach about starting out on the arduous but critical degrowth journeys I believe we must all begin. </p>



<p>We need to leave much that we’ve built behind; status, professional reputations and the stuff we’ve accumulated and venture into unfamiliar territories contoured by new assumptions on which we can found more generative cultures and more compassionate ways of being. There are personal journeys to be made that require us to get damn good at crossing borders. Traversing ideological borders; conversing beyond the increasingly polarised spaces that now make up our society. Perhaps more than anything though, <em>crossing the borders we create with our minds</em>; the inner language of limits that reflects outer limits we impose as we inhabit spaces prescribed by borders reinforced and policed by our social conditioning<em>, </em>the endless ways we comply with narratives or societal practices that are not serving us, humanity or the planet.Prescribed lives lived within limits so as to comply with economic growth and free markets that know no limits. How often when we discuss imposing limits on growth, do we conflate that with imposing limits on self – as if growth <em>is</em> us? Sure personal choices and consumer behaviour are bound up in the issue. But it is not the same. It is not transactional. When we cease to live within limits in this sense, when we act outwith these borders we start to language new possibilities, new forms of dialoguing with others and the world, and find new ways to be in solidarity with one another. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="768" height="1024" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sleepbags-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8087" srcset="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sleepbags-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sleepbags-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sleepbags-585x780.jpg 585w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sleepbags-100x133.jpg 100w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sleepbags.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<p>A favourite quote of mine is from the Aboriginal
activist Lilla Watson who suggests; </p>



<p>“<em>if
you have come here to help me – you are wasting your time. If you have come
because your liberation is bound up with mine, then let us work together.</em>” </p>



<p>It describes perfectly the difference in power
relation bound up in charity as distinct from solidarity. I saw in these
citizen-led, self-initiated responses to the migrant crisis, training grounds where
people were working together in ways that recover our collective liberation.
Acts that go beyond transactional offers of charity. Training grounds for
acting outwith the status quo, beyond the mediated experiences of consumer
society, where transactional ways of relating form a radical monopoly on too
much of our lives; how we vote, how we meet our needs, how we offer compassion.
Here people are learning another way of responding – beyond campaigning, beyond
donations, beyond petitions and beyond governments or NGOs. A way of responding
that is immediate, founded in mutual aid and rooted in self-organising. Direct
responses to another individual’s situation – hard to imagine compassion more
radical than that. Powerful lessons in building the kind of bottom-up
counterpower I believe is called for in bringing about the order of change
essential both for degrowth or deep adaptation. These are the spaces where we
prefigure new ways of being, new manners of organising society, engage in the life-giving
business of Holloway’s <em>doing</em>. These are the experiences that once tasted
are never lost. That I tasted at spaces like Pollok Free State. That the
student from Edinburgh has tasted at the Refugee Community Kitchen.
Countercultural spaces we will continue to seek out because on some level we
know there is something more essential to our human beingness that we find there.
Countercultural spaces that can generate a wider culture that supports new
expressions of society and humanity in the face of the current crisis-cluster. </p>



<p>Migrant solidarity is evidently a clear area around which people are self-organising and ‘acting out’; the kind of citizen-led responses I set out to find. I wonder about the scale of this response &#8211; it would be interesting to map this kind of activity, if someone hasn’t done so already. Although it’s also true that those I’ve visited are small in comparison to the sheer numbers of displaced peoples passing through Europe. And then I’m reminded of another quote &#8211; by the German poet Rilke; <br><br>“<em>Again and again in history some people wake up. They have no ground in the crowd and move to broader deeper laws. They carry strange customs with them and demand room for bold and audacious action. The future speaks ruthlessly through them.</em>”<br> The language of the future knows no limits, other than those we create ourselves. <br></p>

<p><br><em><strong>Nishma Doshi travelled around Europe with our </strong></em><a href="https://www.enough.scot/routes-response/"><em><strong>Routes programme</strong></em></a><em><strong>. Here they describe how fighting for housing rights is a part of climate justice in Barcelona.</strong></em></p>



<p><br>What is climate justice? What are we fighting for when we talk about stopping climate change?</p>



<p>Climate breakdown is a problem because it threatens our lives. It threatens our lives because it makes the world around us inhospitable, to us and to other species. It means losing our homes, access to clean water, access to good nutritious food, access to all our basic needs.</p>



<p>So when we are fighting for survival &#8211; which is what stopping climate change is about &#8211; we are fighting for our basic needs. We are fighting for healthy lives; we are fighting for the continued access to our basic needs. That&#8217;s ultimately what climate justice is about. It&#8217;s about an globally equal and equitable access to that which gives us life.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why one of my stops in Barcelona was at the <a href="http://labase.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">La Base: Ateneu Co-operatiu</a>, where the <a href="http://sindicatdebarri.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sindicat de barri del Poble Sec</a> (the neighbourhood union for the Poble Sec area) were having their weekly assembly. </p>



<p>Across Barcelona, different neighbourhoods (barris) have collectively organised to stop evictions and protect basic housing rights. Poble Sec is of particular interest as it is relatively small neighbourhood with a diverse population; residents come from across Europe, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador and Pakistan &#8211; as well as local Catalans.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The weekly meetings</h3>



<p>The sindicat meets once a week on Monday night. There, they discuss general strategies for upcoming political issues as well as provide support for community cases. Folks with cases &#8211; largely related to housing &#8211; drop their names in a jar at the beginning of the meeting, and after the strategy session ends, those names are pulled out, they get a chance to state their case, and assembly members collectively suggest support and solutions. </p>



<p>To be more inclusive, the meetings are held in Spanish (Castellano) as many of the migrants from Latin America do not speak Catalan. This is quite an important compromise made as many Catalans refuse to speak Castellano as a voice of dissent against the Spanish government which has repeatedly, and violently, repressed Catalonia&#8217;s demand for independence &#8211; as we are witnessing right now.</p>



<p>As I don&#8217;t speak Castellano or Catalan, I was kindly invited to the assembly by one of the sindicat&#8217;s members &#8211; Lorenzo. While the original aim of the sindicat was to deal with many political issues, he tells me, most of the actual organising work ends up being around housing as that is what is most urgent. Evictions are common due to rent rises, and increased property speculation. Most cases that come to the sindicat are related to evictions.</p>



<p>With Barcelona increasingly building its economy around tourism, property speculation in popular areas &#8211; like the city centre &#8211; is rampant. Airbnb** has also become a problem, with an increasing amount of flats and spare bedrooms used for temporary tourists rather than for local community housing. </p>



<p>There are also issues around rights to rent for those without the right papers &#8211; that can mean rights of residency to landlords requiring long-term job contracts. Many migrants feel caught in a trap: without rights of residency it is hard to find a job; and without a job it is impossible to rent a space in order to acquire rights of residency. This can be a problem for EU migrants too.</p>



<p>The meetings are organised in a circle (as far as possible) &#8211; with members volunteering for different roles each week. These roles can be &#8220;Masters of Ceremony&#8221; to childcare to welcoming new members. Fragments of the meeting which were translated to me were decisions on how to show solidarity with another barri eviction to how to respond to the sentences placed on Catalan leaders pushing for independence. It is observable how most of the strategy section engages more of the ethnic Catalan activists, while the racialised people* remain mostly quiet. <br><br>The case work is particularly interesting &#8211; and this is really where the issues of the immigrant population are raised. Once a name is called from the jar, that person either states their problem or gives an update on their case. Members of the community then give their advice and expertise. If needs be, the community will come together and stop an eviction or campaign together to challenge a landlord or the municipal government.</p>



<p>It is also important to note that, of the racialised people in attendence, almost all were women. I was told that women are often left with the responsibility of seeking help/support, especially in issues of housing and the family. This work is deeply gendered, with the majority of the responsibility falling on women.</p>



<p>Furthermore there is a visible divide between the racialised peoples in the space and the white activists &#8211; the latter seem to hold most of the organisational responsibility. One of them &#8211; Dan &#8211; also pointed out this distinction, calling it a unintentional &#8220;hierarchy&#8221;.</p>



<p>Obviously some work needs to be done to bridge these divides still. As I travelled and spoke to more people in Barcelona, this was an issue that was brought up over and over again. And it&#8217;s also been an issue I&#8217;ve observed in Scotland too. </p>



<p>In my experience, this often comes to how a space is run &#8211; the norms of the organisation can be &#8216;foreign&#8217; to those who have no direct experience of this kind of organising before.  And example of these norms could be consensus decision making or rotating roles. These norms are often uncritically accepted into organisational structures with no real space for reform or explorations of alternatives.</p>



<p>This makes it difficult for those of us who don&#8217;t fully embrace or feel part of anarchist organising to feel distanced or ostracised from the project. We are always working in ways which are culturally suited for our white colleagues and not really for us or the communities we come from. A longer discussion on community organising methods which centres the experiences of marginalised and racialised people seems really necessary if we want to overcome these divides.<br></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">La Base: Ateneu Co-operatiu</h3>



<p>La Base was formed after the Indignados movement, when people felt it was necessary to have infrastructure and access to amenities in order to organise for change.</p>



<p>The space has meeting rooms, a daily kitchen co-operative which serves up an affordable lunch, a workspace for basic building and repairs, a feminist collective, and a number of other projects apart from the sindicat. The projects provide local employment and benefits local companies and businesses.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Housing Justice is Climate Justice</h3>



<p>Hurricane Katrina destroyed the lives of so many people, houses were flooded and washed away. But the oak trees remained. They stood tall and weathered the storm because their roots were intertwinned. Of the over 700 oak trees in New Orleans, only 40 died. The rest held on.<br><br>As we saw with Katrina, responses to the catastrophic effects of climate change are deeply racialised. Black working class communities are still not getting the support they need.</p>



<p>As Clara-Luisa Weichelt and Julieta Perucca explain:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>&#8220;Governments worldwide fail to provide safe housing and basic infrastructure for a massive amount of people – and the challenges are increasing. People are frequently driven to live in informal settlements by environmental factors, such as natural disasters or environmental degradation that tend to happen more frequently due to climate change. But, the settlements to which they migrate also place them at risk: Nonresistant houses on land that is at risk of flooding, storm surges, mudslides, earthquakes, or contaminated sites, close to roads, waste and/or factories, is more likely to be vacant and is less likely to be contested for investment or development. The lack of basic infrastructure as access to drinking water, health provision, sewage systems, electricity and education as well as the lack of political and social recognition further exacerbates their vulnerability.&#8221;</p><cite><a href="https://www.habitants.org/news/global_info/the_nexus_between_the_right_to_housing_and_climate_change_insights_from_the_climate_conference_cop24_in_katowice_poland" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Nexus between the Right to Housing and Climate Change</a> – Insights from the Climate Conference COP24 in Katowice, Poland, (Thursday 10 January 2019)</cite></blockquote>



<p>Adequate housing rights for all, especially the marginalised in essential in preventing the worst impacts of climate change. Given the failure of governments to meet these basic needs, it has become essential that communities organise together to defend their rights.</p>



<p>If we want to survive what climate change is throwing at us now, as well as in the future, we need to find ways to supporting each other. The sindicat de barri del Poble Sec is one way which people are building connections and working together to deal with housing insecurity. While it&#8217;s not perfect, it&#8217;s providing many people with the support that they need; support that prevents them from ending up homeless and on the street.</p>

<p>*In Spain, People of Colour (PoC) or Black, Indigenous and People of Colour (BIPOC) are not used. The word commonly used translates as &#8220;racialised people&#8221;. This is because the process of Spain&#8217;s colonisation was dissimilar to that of British colonialism, and thus racial categories are different. <br>** While Spain has passed a law requiring all Airbnbs to pay taxes, EU data protection laws allow Airbnb to not disclose who is renting a room through the service. This means that the government struggles to enforce the tax. (This has been further impacted by a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/airbnb-wins-legal-victory-as-top-eu-court-defines-firm-as-information-society-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent EU court ruling</a> that has declared Airbnb not a real estate company)</p>
