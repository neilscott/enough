<p><strong>LESS<em> editor Svenja Meyerricks spoke to environmental justice activist and community organiser Nomalizo Xhoma in Johannesburg, South Africa, about her work and advocacy for solutions that centre the needs of vulnerable communities where the impact of climate change is acutely felt.</em></strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="838" height="1024" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1024-1252-838x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9581" srcset="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1024-1252-838x1024.png 838w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1024-1252-245x300.png 245w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1024-1252-768x939.png 768w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1024-1252-585x715.png 585w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1024-1252-100x122.png 100w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1024-1252.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 838px) 100vw, 838px" /></figure>



<p>When I first met Nomalizo in a German ecovillage we both were visiting, she taught a group of permaculture students to sing ‘<em>Shosholoza’</em>, a South African mining song that had become a protest anthem of black communities in the anti-apartheid struggle. Nomalizo’s transmission of the song was an electrifying experience for everyone present – the ongoing community struggle behind it was palpable. Ever since, I have been following Nomalizo’s campaigning work in Johannesburg from a distance. I reconnected with her on a video call to talk about the COP and her climate justice activism.</p>



<p>Nomalizo works for Earthlife Africa (<a href=""><u>earthlife.org.za</u></a>), a South African environmental justice organisation that initially played a radical activist role as part of the anti-nuclear movement. Nowadays, Earthlife Africa’s work is focused on energy and climate change.</p>



<p>Nomalizo Xhoma (NX): “About 90% of our energy is being produced from coal, which contributes most to greenhouse gases, and 5% from nuclear energy. We advocate for renewable energy and a Just Transition through our labour movement. We really want to push businesses that are focused on profit-making, but we also need our government to have the political will to also push for change through a Just Transition to a low-carbon economy.”</p>



<p>As renewable technology is not yet widely available, it is more difficult for South Africa to move away from extractivist energy industries. Communities living near new mining developments are not sufficiently informed about their risks and health hazards, and displaced from their land and ways of life.</p>



<p>NX: “In South Africa, about 30% of youth are unemployed. So when they introduced nuclear energy they promised the youth jobs, because they know that everyone is vulnerable, everyone needs jobs. And there won’t be any new jobs, and what about the livelihoods of people who are farming and living an Indigenous life? – because when they build a new [nuclear or coal] power station people will be moved from one area to another so that those big indust<a>ries can come in and open a new mine. These new developments impact people in different ways – at times people who are used to living on a farm in an open space are being relocated and clustered in a small township.”</a></p>



<p><a>“Because people are hungry, and people are vulnerable, that&#8217;s when people will say, ‘Yes, we really need this’ – not understanding the impacts and the externalities of all those things that coal and nuclear energy industries are promising.”</a></p>



<p><a>The communities Nomalizo and other Earthlife Africa activists are working with are already experiencing the impact of climate change.</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="838" height="1024" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/people-838x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9582" srcset="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/people-838x1024.jpg 838w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/people-245x300.jpg 245w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/people-768x939.jpg 768w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/people-585x715.jpg 585w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/people-100x122.jpg 100w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/people.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 838px) 100vw, 838px" /></figure>



<p><a>NX: “They are now feeling it, because in South Africa we have a problem with water. So as you can imagine, if we have a water problem then that means food security is going to be a problem. And then that means our health is at risk.”</a></p>



<p><a>Earthlife Africa’s role is to distribute information, and to empower communities they work with to come up with their own solutions to the challenges they are facing, especially in relation to climate change and energy. Their popular education initiatives in communities facing large-scale coal and nuclear energy developments support residents to make well-informed decisions about whether to accept or reject these new developments.</a></p>



<p><a>NX: ”We work in different provinces – in Limpopo Province, where the new coal mines are proposed; and we also work in the Eastern Cape, where the new nuclear power plant was supposed to be built. We keep sensitising the community and doing education, letting them know what is new, so that they have an understanding [of the impacts of these energy industries] and can make a sound decision.&nbsp;Our government and businesses do the environmental impact assessment and public consultations, but they don&#8217;t do the community outreach whereby you tell the people what is it that you come in with.”</a></p>



<p><a>“We organise people, we mobilise people, we tell them about this. And then we make a lot of noise! We tweet about it, we raise awareness, and people are able to engage and talk about it, and reject what must be rejected.”</a></p>



<p><a>“Communities are the ones who have solutions. It&#8217;s just that our government doesn&#8217;t take them seriously; they don&#8217;t take them into consideration. People’s Indigenous knowledge is so great. It just needs a political will to say, ‘Yes, this must be pushed forward. Let us listen to the people; let us stop lying to the people. Let us tell people the truth, so that people can make their own choice.’”</a></p>



<p><a>Nomalizo explains how population displacement across the African continent through the impacts of climate change is further brought into tension by the false promise of employment opportunities in South Africa.</a></p>



<p><a>NX: “South Africans feel that [people from other African countries] are coming to take their jobs. But those people didn&#8217;t come because they wanted to take their jobs. They came here because they&#8217;re running away – because Africa, further north, it&#8217;s dry. So if the place is not conducive for you to live, you move, thinking that they will find a better place to live here. This was a focus of our climate march in 2017 – that, in some places in South Africa, we are now seeing climate refugees.”</a></p>



<p><a>We speak about LESS’s focus on degrowth and decolonisation, and the need to degrow some sectors so that there can be enough for all. I ask Nomalizo what this means in a South African context.</a></p>



<p><a>NX: “We push to say we really need renewable energy, but not in the sense that a big company from China will come and install renewable energy and do maintenance, and then people must pay that company for services. We need renewable energy that is community owned and community-driven – that the community will have a say in it. That will be much better for communities – to create their own jobs for their own people.</a></p>



<p><a>And that will also assist in empowering the youth, and empowering communities in different areas.</a></p>



<p><a>What we normally do is we mobilise women. I also work on gender justice, so we know that women are the ones who are carrying the burden at the end of the day; they are the most vulnerable to climate change and [extractivist energy developments]. So we also advocate for gender equality, and we mobilise women on the issues of climate change – we provide support, and especially engage those who are coming from marginalised communities. We assist them so that they are able to engage with the government on implementing climate change mitigation and adaptation policies. That&#8217;s why I always work with different community organisations. They might choose to protest because we help them by raising environmental awareness.”</a></p>



<p><a>Our conversation shifts to the question of land, who owns it, and whose voices are heard or silenced.</a></p>



<p><a>NX: “There are a lot of communities that are pushing for their Indigenous life to be recognised and also their rights to land, and also pushing for their rights to be recognised as it is in our South African constitution. Remember, most of the land in South Africa is not owned by South Africans, so South Africans are not seen as the custodians of South Africa – all we really need is to be recognised as Indigenous people of South Africa. Land is mostly owned by investors – people in Europe, America, Asia – and these days in Europe people let us think that they lease the land, that they don’t own it. So we are still fighting for land rights.”</a></p>



<p><a>Ten years ago, COP17 took place in Durban, South Africa. Since then, the majority of UN Climate Change Conferences (UNFCCC) have taken place in the global north. While no legally binding agreement to reduce carbon emissions was made in Durban, the summit was an important step in the process towards forging the Paris Agreement in 2015.&nbsp; I ask Nomalizo about her experience of protesting at COP17 .</a></p>



<p><a>NX: “It was like the Corporation of the Parties; [COP] was only corporations. It was not representing people; it was only representing businesses. Our electricity supplier here is Eskom. So with Eskom and Sasol being the biggest polluters, how can they be part of the negotiators at COP? Because we don&#8217;t need people who are degrading our environment to be the one who also goes to that table and talks about change – they know that they&#8217;re not going to change anything; they are only concerned with profit, not people and the environment. So in 2011, we were saying this was not for us. It doesn&#8217;t represent us. And we were demanding climate justice, because if there&#8217;s no justice, then it&#8217;s just business as usual.</a></p>



<p><a>There was an agreement to say there will be a Green Climate Fund, which is still just a name – developed countries were supposed to fund that. They pledged to say they will contribute. But even today, it&#8217;s a drop in the ocean. So yes, we were happy to say at least there&#8217;s something that we came out with, to say there will be reparation, developed countries will assist developing countries. But when you check, that is still far from happening.</a></p>



<p><a>We managed to organise a lot of people – but not everything that we hoped for happened. With our government, after COP, we started seeing development – wind turbines, solar panels, and all that. We&#8217;ve seen that it&#8217;s starting to happen, even though it&#8217;s still a little, it’s at a very slow pace – but we’re getting there, as long as the community can push for change.”</a></p>



<p><a>With added restrictions during the pandemic, it has become even more difficult for climate justice campaigners who work with those most affected by the impacts of climate change to make their voice heard at the talks. Now that the UNFCCC meets for the 26<sup>th</sup> time, what will communities at the frontline of the impacts of climate change be doing?</a></p>



<p><a>NX: “During COP26, our director will be in Glasgow. And then we will be having our week of action here in South Africa – we will be doing popular workshops on climate change, and also updating people on what is happening in Glasgow, and for the whole week we&#8217;ll be having our small meetings with different community activists. And on the 10th of December it’s International Human Rights Day. We will have a big march – we are expecting around 4,000 people to say we are aware of climate change and we need climate justice now. Normally when we do it, we will go to different financial institutions that are investing in fossil fuels that contribute most to greenhouse gases. We will go to the banks who are funding the mining of fossil fuels such as coal. And then we&#8217;ll end our march at the Constitutional Court to give them the memorandum saying we feel that our rights to a healthy and clean and safe environment are being violated.”</a></p>



<p><a>“We are pushing very hard for a Just Transition to reduce fossil fuels and use renewables as an alternative in South Africa. The government is also talking about a Just Transition, and we are waiting to see what they say when they are in Glasgow. Because it&#8217;s easy to say things, but when they come back to implement what they&#8217;ve said, it&#8217;s not what they do in the country.”</a></p>



<p><a>I ask Nomalizo if she has a message for Glasgow.</a></p>



<p><a>NX: “For this year our message is that we globally need a Just Transition to a low carbon economy. And globally, we need to change everything that we&#8217;re doing that is not environmentally friendly.”</a></p>



<p><a>“Only ordinary people can push for change, because they are not looking for profit.”</a><br><br></p>



<p><strong>People </strong><strong>B</strong><strong>efore </strong><strong>P</strong><strong>rofit!</strong></p>



<p><strong>Renewable Energy =</strong><strong> People’s Power!</strong></p>



<p><strong>Climate Justice Now!</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Territorial struggle and prefigurative politics were evident at the Pollok Free State in the 1990s, opening up new possibilities beyond protest. To mark the occasion of COP26 taking place in Glasgow, Pablo Routledge, Gehan Macleod and David Lees write how a new Govan Declaration of Independence </em>– <em>a Govan Free State at GalGael </em>–<em> is creating a space for gathering and pose critical questions about power and political imagination in a time of climate emergency.</em></strong></p>

<p>This November, Glasgow will be hosting the 26<sup>th</sup> United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) meeting – or Conference of Parties (COP 26). Previous COP meetings over the past 25 years have yielded few enforceable agreements, while greenhouse gas emissions have soared globally, precipitating climate breakdown.</p>



<p>The COP26 meeting in Glasgow comes at a critical time given the accentuation of the climate emergency across the world. In this year alone, we have witnessed the lethal and destructive power of wild fires across the Western United States, Siberia, Greece, Turkey, and Italy; floods in China, Australia, Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands; record winter storms in Spain and the US; hurricane, cyclone, and large storm impacts in the US, Fiji, Indonesia, and the UK; and dust storms in China.</p>



<p>While government negotiators will meet in Glasgow sequestered from the general public, protestors from around the world will congregate in the city to demand climate justice. Climate justice foregrounds how participation and accountability can come into conversation with the need for sustainability and social justice. This recognises the interconnectedness of the issues underlying capitalism – namely, that ecological destruction and economic domination in the name of profits and growth, as well as racial, gender, and class oppressions, are the key drivers of social and environmental injustice.</p>



<p>Such injustices have a long and complex history of having been resisted in different ways across the planet. One form of resistance against environmental injustice and exploitation has come in the form of ‘free states’ and ‘autonomous zones’ of various kinds. Indeed, the notion of free states as spaces of autonomy, communing, and engagement has a long and rich activist history.</p>



<p>In the early 1990s, Pollok Free State was created as a protest encampment in Glasgow as part of mobilisations against the construction of the M77 motorway in the city. These in turn formed part of a broader wave of anti-roads protests that emerged in the UK during the 1990s, challenging the Tory government’s road building programme<strong>.</strong></p>



<p>Pollok Free State was an encampment of tree houses, tents, and benders (do-it-yourself dwellings) located in the Barrhead woods of Pollok Estate in the path of the projected motorway. Located south of Glasgow’s River Clyde, the Free State was sited amidst several low-income housing estates, including those of Pollok, Corkerhill, and Arden. Emerging in 1992&nbsp;out of the actions of Colin Macleod, an Earth First! activist and Pollok resident, the camp acted as a visible symbol of resistance to the motorway. It stood as a critique of the environmental damage caused by road building and an example of how people might live their lives differently, issuing its own passports as symbols of autonomy from the British state, more than four years before the Scottish parliament was inaugurated. <em>Pollok Free State </em>would go on to inspire many and for years to come, and morphed into the GalGael Trust (1) in Govan, a community organisation which Colin saw as a modern day people reclaiming the right to self-determination.</p>



<p>Free States and autonomous zones symbolically announce the act of claiming, bordering, and making space, as well as the contestation over land use. (2) The making of space in such zones involves various objectives and operations, including establishing media and communications infrastructures that provide mainstream media tents, liaisons, and activist media alongside everyday protest activities that constitute the free states as sites of social reproduction. These include legal, medical, and activist trauma support; governance infrastructures such as meeting spaces, announcement boards, decision-making policy guidelines etc.; and activities that reproduce everyday life in the camps such as dealing with food supply, cooking, shelter, sanitation, and the maintenance of communal and private space.(3)</p>



<p>In France, for example, <em>Zones a</em>&nbsp;<em>Defendre</em> (Zones of Defence, or ZADs) have emerged over the past decade at various locations across the country protesting destructive developments and calling for climate justice. One example is the <a href="https://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2018/05/06/from-paris-to-nantes-state-violence-1968-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZAD at <em>Notre-Dame-des-Landes</em> (near Nantes)</a> constructed on nearly 5,000 acres of wetlands, farmland, and hamlets to protest the construction of an airport planned by the French government in partnership with Vinci’s (the world’s largest multinational construction firm). As an integral part of their resistance, this ZAD has practiced creative alternatives to resource extraction through cultivating crop rotations of wheat and buckwheat, and establishing a textile workshop, microbrewery, and bakery. (4) As a result of the solidarity forged between local farmers and climate justice activists in their resistance to attacks by armed police and other forms of state repression, the airport was shelved in 2018.</p>



<p>More recently, in 2020, in Seattle (US), hundreds of activists, who had been demonstrating against police brutality since the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, converged on the Capital Hill neighbourhood of the city and set up a peaceful occupied protest. There, they distributed free food and medical supplies, planted community gardens, and held film screenings and workshops. The area was declared the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone and later the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP). During its brief duration, the CHOP was a police-free, self-governing utopia. A food co-op and medics’ corner were established and there were classes, lectures, speakers, poetry, live music, and huge works of art created.</p>



<p>For journalist and political theorist Raul Zibechi, the art of making space in community-based struggles potentially enables a dispersal of power from the state and capital. (5)The social relations generated comprise spaces “in which to build a new social organisation collectively, where new subjects take shape and materially and symbolically appropriate their space.” (6) In Zibechi’s view, territory is <em>the</em> crucial space in which contentious politics are fashioned, understood as both material territory (involving struggles over the access, control, use, and configuration of environmental resources such as land, soil, water, biodiversity, as well as the physical territory of communities, infrastructure, etc.) and immaterial territory (involving struggles over ideas, knowledges, beliefs, conceptions of the world, etc.). (7) For indigenous peoples, inclusive of the relationship to their land and communities, territorial struggles comprise resistance to the theft of land and other resources and the appropriation by capital and the state of indigenous sovereignty. (8)</p>



<p>Such ‘territorial’ struggles are conceptualised by Zibechi as “societies in movement”, defined through their creation of social relations of autonomy characterised by the (re)appropriation of resources, increased potentials for co-operation and transversal connection, the generation of new types of knowledge and capacities that facilitate self-organisation, and more horizontalist (i.e. non-hierarchical) organisational forms. (9) Many of these characteristics have been termed forms of ‘prefigurative politics’ (i.e. living now the future that is desired). The spaces they make represent ‘commons’ – resources that are collectively owned or shared between people and the relational power generated by folk acting and being-in-common. (10)</p>



<p>Making and creating space is also about articulating the symbolic significance of particular spaces and the protests that take place within them. Practices of prefigurative politics, or ‘societies in movement’, symbolise the disruption of and a resistance to neoliberal capital accumulation and the attendant climate breakdown, articulating alternatives to the status quo.</p>



<p>In our age of climate emergency, all struggles for climate justice become prefigurative territorial struggles in one way or another. For example, struggles by farmers’ movements in the majority world for food sovereignty (i.e. farmers’ control over the means of environmentally sustainable and culturally appropriate food production) take claiming and/or defence of land as a starting point for struggle. Struggles for community-owned energy renewables require a territorial basis for the siting and production of that energy, such as with the<em> Energiewende</em> (energy transition) in Germany. (11)</p>



<p>Many of the characteristics outlined above – including territorial struggle and prefigurative politics – were evident at the <em>Pollok Free State </em>in the 1990s. The act of declaring a free state opened up new possibilities beyond protest: new imaginaries, new forms of discourse. It was undoubtedly a site of social reproduction – something that is still true of GalGael today. As COP convenes for a 26th occasion, and as GalGael prepare to celebrate our 25th year, we could not escape the irony in the convention landing a few blocks away from our workshop. With UN and UK law poised to displace Scots law in the Blue and Green zones for the duration of COP, we thought it fitting to mark the occasion by declaring independence anew, with a <a href="http://www.govanfreestate.scot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Govan Free State.</a></p>



<p>Colin Macleod would come to describe Pollok Free State as a leading question, asking “Where is our democracy? Where is our parliament?” (12) Much has taken place in the past 25 years, but too little has changed. <a href="http://www.govanfreestate.scot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Govan Free State</a> will pose similar critical questions about power and political imagination in the face of climate collapse – questions set alight by the winds of wildfires and a global pandemic. We want to divest of our faith in the instruments and institutions that seem unable to respond adequately, while acknowledging the many people with tender intentions caught up in these mechanics. We will look to constitute a ’convergence space’ (13) of community members, activists, ideas, dialogue, and creativity, where folks will articulate together shared concerns and collective visions to generate a politics of solidarity founded on common ground.</p>



<p>A Govan Declaration of Independence, framed by a critical understanding of interdependence and radical dependence, will bring a wholly different aspect to the multitude of grassroots initiatives taking place in the city. Through it, we will playfully explore the notion of nations and states, alongside what it means to be a people of plural heritages. We want to explore practices to reclaim responsibility for the contested territories of our collective futures. The statement “<em>declare yourself welcome</em>” will define the borders of our territories. We’ll print and issue our own passports and make our own ceremonial ‘objects of state’. We’ll also invite others to declare their own Free States and hope to launch a downloadable <em>Declare Yourself A Free State </em>pack, a template for a constellation of distributed Free States. This is an invitation to “decolonise yersel” – be that your bedroom, your tenement close, your street, your community garden, however you might choose to define your territory – in a declaration of hope, of intent, of solidarity to counter fatalism and fire radical imagination.</p>

<p>Here in Govan, in the midst of an existence wrought with inter-generational trauma and unprocessed pain, we will gather ourselves and our practices of collective grieving – needed now more than ever as climate catastrophes coalesce. In the face of so many false solutions and uncertainty, we hope to create experiences of quiet, depth, and meaning so as to process harsh realities and draw strength.</p>



<p>Our <a href="http://www.govanfreestate.scot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Govan Free State</a> gatherings will also reclaim cultural inheritances and remember our own traditions, folklore, songs. Inspired by thinkers such as Hamish Henderson his ‘Freedom Come-All-Ye’ (14) and evoking the tradition of hospitality, the Free State will breathe life into discourse centred on our emancipation, independence, and international reconciliation through shared space, food, and music.</p>



<p>We note that COP26 starts near the time of All Hallows, All Saints, and the much older <em>Samhai</em>n – a Gaelic liminal or threshold festival marking the end of the four quarters of the Celtic year. It is a seasonal time of waning light and of passing over, a time for the death of old systems – and perhaps the birth of new worlds? We will also invoke older laws and traditional practices from the Althing (assembly fields) of Iceland or the Udal Law of Shetland and Orkney or, closer, from the ancient law mound of Doomster Hill here in Govan. We will make oaths to wild places, dying species, and more climate vulnerable communities and peoples. And we will explore with curiosity traditional forms of gathering and place-making, such as the ancient practice of the <em>aonach</em>, or great assembly.</p>



<p>By reclaiming territories, material and immaterial, we seek to stand with other indigenous peoples globally and all those left vulnerable, marginalised, or brutalised by the growing extremities of wealth and weather or many other forms of violence. Our hope is that the Free State will extend a gesture ‘beyond itself’ (15) and even beyond Glasgow. Such spaces consist of a series of spatially distributed acts and processes: those physically present are always part of more spatially extensive virtual and digital networks of support and organisation.</p>



<p>Political activities of alliance can open up the political order for challenge, through visible, embodied acts of resistance. Alliance building for climate justice must also invent ways of saying, seeing, and being, that nurture a politics of affinity, and that engender new forms of collective and inclusive enunciation, engendering new subjects for the uncertain futures that await us all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Hello world. Welcome to Glasgow. Welcome to Scotland. We are drawing on Glasgow’s radical past to inject hope and urgency into the moribund COP process.</strong><br><br>YOUR VISION OF our country may be an idealised one of lochs brimming with salmon and glens filled with deer, but in reality we’re a petro-chemical economy being held ransom by the British State. Our most famous icons and exports – our salmon and deer and grouse – are really symbols of a country disfigured by landed power. We remain a semi-feudal nation with one of the most unequal distributions of land ownership in the world. </p>



<p>In Gaelic, Glasgow means ‘Dear Green Place’, but Glasgow was also known from the 19th century as the Second City of the Empire, a city that became synonymous with massive expansion, global trade, industry, invention, and shipbuilding. </p>



<p>For almost 200 years, the statue of the celebrated Scottish inventor and engineer James Watt has stood in George Square. Every schoolchild is taught about the invention of the steam engine in 1776, which was fundamental to the changes brought by the Industrial Revolution across the world. What’s less well known is that Watt’s father was a slave trader, a colonial merchant who subsidised his son. The development of the steam engine was funded by slavery. Watt himself was involved in colonial commerce and played a direct role in the trafficking of enslaved people. </p>



<p>With Glasgow playing host to the COP in 2021, we have historical symmetry. It’s more of a loop than a continuum; as the world faces climate catastrophe, the same city that was pivotal in the Industrial Revolution, colonisation, and Empire is the city that must now be the pivot towards decolonisation and degrowth. </p>



<p>Mirroring the challenge facing humanity itself, the city of Glasgow needs to find ways to move beyond the old story that it has become defined by. This is not just about moving beyond an industrial legacy and identity; it’s about moving beyond a history of violence and ongoing destruction. Like the abandoned coalfields that pockmark Fife and Ayrshire, the empty docks that still line the Clyde speak to communities left to mass unemployment and intergenerational trauma. For Glasgow, and for the rest of us, degrowth is about finding ways of living and being beyond our obsession with productivity and consumption and GDP. It’s about working towards a radical&nbsp;transformation of our society to one which serves a new function: supporting the flourishing and sustaining of life. </p>



<p>The path towards this transformation or ‘transition’ is faint and hard to make out. Any movement of change left to market forces motivated by profits and constrained within the economics of globalisation – a political and economic ideology based on exploitative practices towards people, land, and nature – will follow the same inevitable path to destruction. After a year in the trauma of the pandemic, the climate crisis came to Europe. Extreme weather visited the Global North with an unrecognisable summer of flooding, wildfires, and extreme heat. Even the most complacent were woken from their slumbers to confront a present and future of climate emergency that can no longer be ignored. We are heading full steam into a world of fossil-fuel expansion and mass extinction of species, including our own. As the IPPC report stated, we are living in “code red for humanity: the alarm bells are deafening, and the evidence is irrefutable.” </p>



<p>Yet, incredibly, the Prime Minister – of the UK government Scotland did not elect – is preparing to sign off on a new drilling permit at Cambo oilfield, west of Shetland.1 If approved, Cambo would produce 170m barrels of oil and would deepen the climate crisis for decades to come. [2] It is a staggeringly backward move, an exercise in futility and, ultimately, a crime against humanity. In Scotland, we don’t have full democratic control over our future path, and in this situation there is an echo of the climate predicament. In a world where greenwash and disinformation dominate, it’s easy to feel alienated and see only the futility of the process. </p>



<p>The COP26 Coalition joined calls for the summit’s postponement, stating: <br><br><strong>“As the clock ticks on this crucial decade, rich countries must commit to doing their fair share of climate action, cutting emissions to zero and paying their carbon debt to the global South. This is the bare minimum needed to pave the way for a successful COP26, yet the COP Presidency is far from showing such leadership [&#8230;] From climate to Covid the UK has shown it is willing to sacrifice those worst off to shore up huge profits for the few.” [3] </strong></p>



<p>The challenge is not to be consumed by the huge gravitational pull and distraction of COP – its hype, its false hope, its unreality, its greenwashed credentials and stagemanaged accords. The challenge is to organise within communities and resist the police state, to speak the truth, to cultivate outrage, to create a rupture, to challenge inevitability, and to imagine, articulate, and build different futures. Our humantiy and our home is under threat. </p>



<p><strong>BEING HUMAN </strong></p>



<p>IF, AS THE IPCC stated: “All pathways begin now and involve rapid and unprecedented social transformation”, then Glasgow has a radical political history to inspire the movement. </p>

<p>Glasgow is not just a city of Empire built on exploitation; it is also a city built on struggle. Whether it’s Mary Barbour’s rent strikes or John Maclean and Red Clydeside in the early 20th century, Jimmy Reid and the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders of 1971, the anti-Polaris and CND movement, the Anti-Poll Tax Campaign, the anti-apartheid movement, Pollok Free State in the 1990s, the Kenmure Street protest of 2021 or the countless unsung pockets of radical and inspired action in the communities that make up the fabric of the city, there is much to learn from Glasgow’s radical past. </p>



<p>Other sources of local inspiration include Jimmy Reid’s Rectorial Address to the University of Glasgow in 1972, a speech that has had reverberations and resonance down the years. He could be speaking to us directly today: </p>



<p><strong>“Let me right at the outset define what I mean by alienation. It is the cry of men who feel themselves the victims of blind economic forces beyond their control. It is the frustration of ordinary people excluded from the processes of decision making. The feeling of despair and hopelessness that pervades people who feel with justification that they have no real say in shaping or determining their own destinies. [&#8230;] Reject these attitudes. Reject the values and false morality that underlie these attitudes. A rat race is for rats. We’re not rats. We’re human beings.” </strong></p>



<p>Some of the critique of the climate crisis turns on humanity; claiming, with the spectre of ecofascism looming, that “We humans are the problem.”. The answer for Reid is not less humanity but less capitalism. The power structures that have emerged threaten and undermine our hard won democratic rights. His words echo down the ages: </p>



<p><strong>“Government by the people for the people becomes meaningless unless it includes major economic decision making by the people for the people. This is not simply an economic matter. In essence it is an ethical and moral question, for whoever decisions in society ipso facto determines the social priorities of that society.” </strong></p>



<p>Our global economy is structured so that disproportionate, dangerous, and unprecedented amounts of wealth and power are centralised and held by the people and multi-national corporations involved in excessive extractive industries driving climate breakdown and ecosystem collapse. They are taking decisions which are not in the interests of you, me, or the billions of people and diverse ecosystems on this planet. In degrowth, we have an opportunity to transfer power away from those bodies towards more democratic structures and processes that centre care and lifesustaining work. We need to shift towards an economy away from growth-at-anycost to an economy that is feminist in the sense of the late Scottish economist Ailsa Mackay [4] and as outlined by Maria Mies [5] : </p>



<p><strong>“The feminist project is basically an anarchist movement which does not want to replace one (male) power elite by another (female) power elite, but which wants to build up a non-hierarchical, non-centralised society where no elite lives off exploitation and dominance over others.” </strong></p>

<p>We also need new mechanisms to sustainably ‘govern the commons’, as sketched out by Elinor Ostrom [6] – which include restoring our oceans and the atmosphere in service of the greater good. Any framework for transitioning to an alternative economic system that does not account for the massive global restructuring of power relations needed – and which does not understand this as a political project – will not deliver the transformation that is needed for everyone – human and more-thanhuman – to live well and flourish on the planet we call home.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We present to you LESS’s ‘Code Red’ issue not simply as a response to the COP, but as a space for voices from the centre to the margins of the struggle for climate justice, degrowth, and decolonisation.</p>



<p> Benjamin Brown makes the case for shutting down the Mossmorran Natural Gas Liquids plant in Fife. Paul Routledge, Gehan Macleod, and David Lees write about the GalGael Free State as an autonomous zone near the ‘blue zone’ where climate talks are talking place. Luke Devlin interviews Craig Bryce about rebel DIY housebuilding and the autonomy that comes with building collectives. Rhyddian Knight interviews David Blair about the ark he built on the Cowal peninsula to highlight the plight of coastal communities. Peter Kitelo Chongeywo of the Ogiek Indigenous Forest Peoples of Mount Elgon, Kenya, sees climate change activism in the UK as fighting for all our tomorrows. Kate Chambers writes about the need to decouple social mobility from resource consumption. Mark Langdon reflects on education for transformation as a crucial tool in a time of ecological and social crisis. Svenja Meyerricks interviews climate justice activist Nomalizo Xhoma in Johannesburg about the COP and community struggles in South Africa. Catriona Spaven-Donn argues for commons food systems that are grounded in collaborative relationships between plants and fungi. And, finally, Vishwam Heckert reflects on the need to unlearn Empire and abstraction and disconnection by unlearning the embodied and psychic habit of separating ‘us’ and ‘them’ or ‘me’ from the ‘world’. </p>



<p>The Dear Green Place is the perfect venue for COP, where all the contradictions and complexities of our past, present, and possible futures are laid bare. Glasgow is a site of both colonisation and decolonisation, imperialism and anti-imperialism. It is a city disfigured by poverty and scarred by violence, exploitation, and trauma. It is also a city of resistance, hospitality, political radicalism, and hope. From Glasgow, we need to forge a world where we are no longer “the victims of blind economic forces beyond our control.” [7]&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The choice is endless growth of global capital or life on earth. It’s a choice we are each going to have to keep fighting for every day.<br><br><strong>COP DISTRIBUTION</strong></p>

<p>There is much talk about ‘Green Economy’ or ‘Green Growth’ as the main solution to climate change. In this teach-in we will examine the fundamental problems of the narratives of Green Growth, how it is preserving a status quo that will further accelerate climate breakdown. In the second part, we’ll take a look at Degrowth as an alternative for a just and social transformation of our society.</p>

<p>Degrowth, while a general critique of our global state of affairs, is fundamentally a situated approach and makes sense for the Global South as an anti-colonial project. Green Growth is pushed as a new language of imperialism in places like Chile and in “energy transitions” initiatives. This teach-in highlights the resistance to the “growth at all costs” that emerges from communities defending their territories and different cosmologies and frames degrowth as a project of global solidarity and human needs.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">We are currently seeking contributions to our upcoming issue <strong>LESS #3</strong>:<strong> Degrowth and Decolonisation in the Red Zone</strong></h3>



<p>The recent<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> IPPC report</a> signals the latest three-alarm warning for humanity and the biosphere. It&#8217;s a red alert for the &#8216;red zone&#8217;- those areas of our planet responsible for the most emissions, which are also now squarely in the floodplain- including Scotland. </p>



<p>Beyond COP26, we invite contributions that focus on Scottish resistance to the climate crisis. The story emerging so far on the road to COP26 from mainstream commentators and media, party politics and corporate PR is that we can carry on industrial civilisation as per usual, by simply inserting a renewably-powered battery in the same old machine. This approach will almost certainly lead to collapse. Rather, we&#8217;re interested in clues and trails that lead away from this collision with planetary limits.  We seek responses that reflect grounded lived practice and fresh-thinking through degrowth and decolonisation to create a future-focused and outward looking climate justice movement. This needs innovation that responds to our times, as well as recovering traditional ecological and cultural knowledge, especially within a Scottish context, which can help restore fragments of meaning in our times of metacrisis. <br><br><strong>Submissions:</strong> We invite a combination of thoroughly researched material, opinion pieces, poetry and art work from those with lived knowledge in these areas, researchers, poets, creative writers and artists. If you&#8217;re interested in submitting a piece, please have a look at our <a href="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LESS.pdf">guidelines for contributors</a> and send us a short summary or abstract of your idea to less@enough.scot asap. We aim to have selected contributors by the end of August. The deadline for finished pieces is 4th October, and we pay a fee of £240.</p>



<p><strong>LESS is a journal on degrowth, radical sufficiency and decolonisation in Scotland.</strong> LESS questions and challenges dominant narratives about what economic progress means in Scotland, and sketches out alternative visions. The focus is on collective and democratic solutions to sustaining livelihoods that meet people’s needs while rising to the threats of climate change, ecocide and mass extinction, inequality, racism and the far right, and the interconnected oppressive and extractivist logic and mechanisms that feed all of those.<br><br><strong>Editorial team:</strong> Mike Small, Dr Mairi McFadyen, Dr Svenja Meyerricks and Luke Devlin</p>
