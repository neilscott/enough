<p><strong>&#8220;Across the continent, millions do not recognize themselves in the climate movement.&#8221;</strong><br><br><strong>Green New Deal for Europe, </strong><em><strong>Blue Print for Europe’s Just Transition </strong></em></p>



<p><strong>&#8220;The consumer is essentially somebody who feels, or is made to feel, lost, unless he or she is consuming. Brand names and logos become the place-names of the Nowhere.&#8221;</strong><br><br><strong>John Berger, </strong><em><strong>Ten Dispatches about Place </strong></em></p>



<p>I take the slow train from Berlin to the Polish border in the early morning. On the platform of an eastern suburban station, tired workers wearing puffer jackets and carrying sports bags smoke and chat in quick snatches of mother-tongue — cheerful at the flashes of recognition. We move through a deep mist settled over plains and forests, and then cross a river. On the other side, another train south, that began its journey at the Baltic sea, speeds along with its cargo segmented in the old fashioned six-person compartments. Everyone who enters is obligated to offer a greeting, and bids farewell to everyone else, having shared this warm space for a stretch. They don’t share much detail about what their journeys are for or where they terminate. </p>



<p>I see forests and small hamlets, some of which we stop at. The great smokestacks of coal-fired power, painted in the national colours of red and white, are one of the few notable reminders that a border has been crossed. The raw variety of capitalism that re-shaped Poland after everything changed 30 years ago, and which is now challenged in turn by a winning mix of nationalism, welfarism and social conservatism, dispensed with old-fashioned loyalties to place. Yet people have shifted to-and-fro here for centuries, and perhaps the outflow of workers to the glittering cluster cities westward from Berlin was inevitable. As inevitable as the ten-hour train home, punctuated by excited calls from relatives, the boredom in anticipation, the slumber needed but not to be achieved — the glittering corporate logos triumphant over Berlin Ostbahnhof, still imprinted on heavy eyelids.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>The rolling stock is probably not that much older than I am – like the post-Communist world, coming to terms with moving into its thirties. Yet, not for the first time, I’m reminded as we power along this fully-electrified line, of the peculiar British backwardness about such things. If this rolling stock originates in the Warsaw Pact era, it’s sobering to recall that much of Britain’s rail infrastructure is essentially still Victorian. </p>



<p>Our island is an island, stuck in its ways. Even if, as measured by the dead metric of growth, it outstrips many of these places, it reproduces itself on a loop. The modernity of Britain is absurd and excitable: simply the spectacle of property and wealth rising beyond the grasp of those who traipse above and underground. Modernity in Europe feels older, wrinkled and cranky, like an old barfly. It has lived through a lot more, if we’re honest. The full employment of Communism and its necessary equivalent in the relative comfort of the western social democracies are gone, but the sight of its worn form still lingering reminds those raised in Britain of the social solidarity that we never <em>really </em>had. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>A
few days later, in Katowice, I realise that the taste and smell of coal in a
large industrialised European city isn’t the only feature that makes the past
feel particularly present. </p>



<p>In this city —&nbsp; think of a coal cottonoplis — winding gear, some of which towers over pits still in use, can be seen across the horizon. 80% of Poland’s electricity still comes from coal, with much of it still hauled from below ground by the state-backed firm PGG. Around Katowice they dig hard coal: the good stuff. </p>



<p>At dawn the next morning I see miners in smart black uniforms and plumed caps wake up the residents of the model mining village Nikiszowiec with their brass band. They represent the opposite of the world of Poland post-EU accession, with its migration of millions of Poles abroad in search of work. Their music beats the bounds of the place they have made through their labours. It is the beginning of <em>Barbórka —</em> the feast day of St Barbara — the patron saint of all those who work in trades likely to be suddenly lethal – but here particularly venerated by miners. </p>



<p>The
getting of coal in Poland has long been fundamental to the national story.</p>



<p>There are no illusions here that this bedrock of history can simply be shrugged off. Although hundreds of thousands have left the industry in recent years, mining is still a major employer. But perhaps the way coal has knitted itself into the cultural fabric of Upper Silesia will be more significant in the longer term. Although for many years a debatable territory where the former domains of the great imperial houses of Europe converged — this is also a Polish heartland and coal is fundamental to what that modern nation became. </p>



<p>The miners were embraced by Communist leaders as a model for Soviet-inspired productivism. Edward Gierek, first secretary of the ruling Polish United Workers&#8217; Party throughout the 1970s, told them: “We will always be honoured to award miners for their effort and contribution to the development of our socialist homeland.”</p>



<p>But
despite their relatively privileged place in the system, miners also played a
seminal role in resistance to the authorities Gierek oversaw. Later, I visit
the weighty monument to nine miners killed at the Wujek colliery in 1981, during
a protracted period of strikes and occupations sparked by the regime’s
imposition of martial law, as living standards plummeted.</p>



<p>The bloody confrontation at Wujek was a pivotal moment in Poland’s transition from Communism, showing the significance of Solidarność&#8217;s actions a year after the Gdańsk Agreement. This use of state violence underlined the moral cause of the trade union&#8217;s protracted fight for national liberation, which, despite many compromises, achieved the unprecedented by establishing an autonomous trade union within a totalitarian system. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Across decades of enormous change — as regimes of different ideological and national stripes came and went in Upper Silesia – the heroic figure of the miner has remained a constant. Within this context, the Polish state’s recent opt-out from the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EU Commission’s Green Deal</a> is unsurprising, as is the minimal interest from miners themselves in talking about transition. Since Katowice hosted COP24 last year, many journalists from Western Europe have traipsed here seeking authentic characters agreeable to a rapid shift away from coal. But there is no shortage of people keen to talk about the difficult lived reality of life in a major coal-producing region. Citizens of small towns like Imielin tell me that they are threatened by a very literal undermining: as PGG seeks to expand mining operations a few hundred metres below their homes. The region also has some of the worst air quality on the continent. </p>



<p>This situation speaks to the questions at the forefront of my journey. How could a carbon transition keep hold of the legacy of democratic and social struggles that placed miners, with their unique role in society, in the vanguard? Could a radical Green New Deal re-establish the old proud loyalty to place: that desire for rootedness and community that the global market has robbed from so many? </p>



<p>The disparities around energy use across different EU regions demonstrates, on a more comprehensible scale, the great unspeakable blasphemy that haunts all talk of transition globally — the notion that growth and prosperity might not be part of the bargain. The idea that places where the missionaries of consumerism are still penetrating should not enjoy its promise, because they heard the gospel too late, makes a mockery of what many consider just. It’s easier to casually come to the view that everyone on the planet should forego a new washing machine, if your grandparents weren’t beaten and imprisoned for daring to object to the fact that no amount of toil would procure basic commodities. </p>



<p>There are three scraps of solace that we can take from this situation. Firstly, as has been shown by the way that people in the global south respond to catastrophic climate events, those with less often retain more resilient community networks — in contrast, high death tolls from heatwaves in Western Europe have been partly attributed to the fact that many elderly people live alone. Secondly, the unconventional history of Solidarność shows that class struggle does not have to follow a pre-ordained path. If working-class collective action can help topple one contradictory ideology, it can do so again. Finally, the way in which the region embraces the cultural significance of coal has a rich symbolic of power. Unlike the UK, they don’t simply want to forget all the dirt and blood bound up in the creation of energy systems &#8211; the focus of the next instalment documenting my journey. </p>

<p><em>Ben Wray assesses the phenomenon of the Green New Deal. where it comes from and what potential it has.</em></p>



<p>I’ve spent a few weeks analysing Green New Deal politics across the western world, reading the latest literature and looking at what is working and what isn’t. I’ve also been researching effective social movements of the past that have changed the course of history, trying to understand what are the common themes of all of them which made them powerful. Finally, I’ve been looking at the General Election manifestos of the main political parties in the UK, to get an idea of what they are proposing. </p>



<p>In this piece I
am going to summarise my findings, briefly presenting what’s going on with the
GND movement, then proposing 10 key do’s and don’t for the movement if it is to
progress. </p>



<p>If you feel you
have a good working knowledge of Green New Deal politics, you may wish to skip
to the section &#8217;10 things the Green New Deal movement should do &#8211; and 10 things
it shouldn’t’.</p>



<p><strong>The Green New
Deal has lift off</strong></p>



<p>It’s remarkable
to think that just over one year ago the Green New Deal was a fringe idea that
almost no one in the mainstream of politics had heard of, never mind taken
seriously. The sea change (no pun intended) since then &#8211; where now it is on the
lips of leaders across the world &#8211; has been driven by a number of factors
coming together at once.</p>



<p>The idea took
off in the space of a week, which started with the pivotal IPCC report coming
out last November on the need to keep warming to 1.5C, and ended with Alexandia
Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) speaking ay the Sunrise movement’s occupation of Democratic
Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office to make the case for a Green New Deal. </p>



<p>Since then, the
idea has taken off like a rocket, spreading across the Atlantic and becoming a
staple of climate politics in the western world. The Fridays for Future and
Extinction Rebellion movements have used protest and direct action to give the
ideas energy and keep the issue in the news. </p>



<p><strong>From a vague
idea towards a concrete goal</strong></p>



<p>Part of the
reason for the Green New Deal’s rapid ascendancy was that people knew it meant
something big and ambitious, but little more than that. This vagueness was a
strength to begin with as a broad coalition of people have been able to project
their own approach on to a common idea for climate action. However, if the
movement is to continue to progress there is a need to rapidly move to a new
phase, where GND promotion and inspiration gives way to concrete plans and
demands for implementation. </p>



<p>If this doesn’t
happen, the danger is that the phrase becomes an empty vessel devoid of real
meaning. Already we’ve seen some leaders and governments disingenuously attach
themselves to the slogan, despite their actual policies not matching up to the
ambitions of the Green New Deal movement. </p>



<p>A growing body
of literature advocating the Green New Deal is clarifying what the term really
means, and what it doesn’t. Recent books by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/14/crisis-talk-green-new-deal-naomi-klein" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Naomi Klein</a> and <a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/09/ann-pettifor-makes-the-case-for-the-green-new-deal.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ann Pettifor</a> are good examples of an increased
intellectual concreteness which is now steering the idea. Think-tank’s like <a href="https://neweconomics.org/uploads/files/newrules2019a.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the New
Economics Foundation</a> and <a href="https://commonweal.scot/our-common-home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Common Weal</a> are adding policy meat to the Green
New Deal skeleton. </p>



<p>A few common
elements can be deciphered from this: </p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>The Green New Deal is about total
economic transformation &#8211; </strong>not simply changing the energy sector, and not simply greening the
system; it is an idea for sustainability and equality for the entire economy.</li><li><strong>The Green New Deal is about a new
economic model &#8211; </strong>Themodel of capitalist development based on what Marx called “accumulation for
accumulation’s sake” &#8211; the pursuit of profit as the bottom line &#8211; on a planet
with finite resources is doomed to crisis and collapse. The financial system
which has built up around the needs of serving capital accumulation with
infinite credit, and the role of the neoliberal state as the protectorate of
that financial system, are therefore also incongruous with a sustainable
economic system. Green New Deal economics is heterogenous in that there are a
number of different approaches, but the common denominator of all of them is a
break with the current paradigm of growth and capital accumulation as the
bottom line.</li><li><strong>The Green New Deal is about acting
where you are, and acting now &#8211;</strong> As the FT <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a42d8c2c-e04a-11e9-9743-db5a370481bc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">succinctly
put it</a> when
describing the ethos behind the Green New Deal: “The goal is to make
decarbonisation a defining national mission rather than an internationally
mandated chore.” GND politics is about collective action for the collective good,
especially on the big priority areas like heating and transport. It is not
about targets, it is not about plans in the distant future, and it is
definitely not about UN summits for the self-aggrandisement of global leaders. </li></ol>



<p><strong>Green New
Deal whirlwind tour</strong></p>

<p>To get an idea
of where Green New Deal politics is at in different places, here is a quick
summary of what’s going on in the US, UK and mainland Europe. </p>



<p><strong>United
States:</strong> The Green
New Deal has become a key part of the Democratic Primary race. It is especially
associated with the left of the Democrats, with Bernie Sanders making it
central to his election campaign, but it’s a sign of the pressure on the
Establishment-wing of the party that Joe Biden, current frontrunner, has also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2019/06/04/joe-biden-embraces-green-new-deal-he-releases-climate-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">formally
backed the idea</a>. </p>



<p>It is also being
pursued legislatively, with a resolution put forward by AOC and Ed Markey to
the Congress in February. But it’s here that the differences are posed most
starkly, with Pelosi welcoming “the enthusiasm” of AOC and Markey’s proposals,
but stating: ““I can’t say we’re going to take that and pass it.” Whereas
AOC’s plan proposes a 2030 transition to zero-carbon which also includes social
measures such as free housing, medical coverage and higher education, Pelosi’s
Bill limits itself to trying to get the US to re-commit to the Paris Agreement.</p>



<p>The Democratic
Primary will be key to what happens next with the Green New Deal in the US,
where the idea has helped re-invigorate socialist politics in in the Democrats,
providing it with a new sense of mission and urgency. With Barack Obama <a href="http://www.apple.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warning that the party</a> is moving “too far left”, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2019/11/27/americans-like-green-new-deals-goals-they-reject-paying-trillions-reach-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trillion-dollar
spending</a>
associated with the US Green New Deal is the sort of issue that he and other
establishment Democrats will be seeking to keep out of the presidential race
with the climate-denying Donald Trump &#8211; who has said the Green New Deal would <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-environment-speech-green-new-deal-press-conference-today-aoc-a8996161.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“kill
millions of jobs”</a> &#8211; at the end of 2020.</p>



<p><strong>UK:</strong> The Green New Deal is now advocated
by all parties on the left to differing degrees. </p>



<p>The Labour Party
has made a ‘green industrial revolution’ central to their <a href="https://labour.org.uk/manifesto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election manifesto</a>, and are promising a £250 billion
‘Green Transformation Fund’ to finance it, as well as a ‘Just Transition Tax’
on the oil &amp; gas corporations which have contributed most to the UK’s
historic carbon emissions, with the money principally being used to fund new
jobs for oil &amp; gas workers in the north-east of Scotland. Labour’s plan to
nationalise the energy sector could also lay the foundations for a GND.</p>



<p>The SNP backs a
GND and is establishing a Scottish National Investment Bank which it says will
have as its principal mission financing the zero-carbon transition. However,
the commitment’s in the party’s <a href="https://www.snp.org/general-election-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election manifesto</a> do not amount to a Green New Deal
in practise, as it prioritises market-based solutions and private sector
subsidies. Nicola Sturgeon has <a href="https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/news/politics/holyrood/1899896/nicola-sturgeon-attacks-jeremy-corbyns-aberdeen-tax-at-snp-manifesto-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also opposed</a> Labour’s Just Transition Tax,
saying she believed it would lead to lost jobs in the oil &amp; gas sector. </p>



<p>The
Conservatives talk about a “Green Industrial Revolution” in <a href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5da42e2cae7ebd3f8bde353c/5dda924905da587992a064ba_Conservative%202019%20Manifesto.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their
manifesto</a>
and say they will spend more on infrastructure but the biggest spending
commitments are on fixing pot-holes in the roads, and under their fiscal rules
will not borrow to invest more than 3 per cent of GDP per year, which means
they can’t get close to the investment needed for a Green New Deal. </p>



<p>The fossil fuel
sector still receives bigger subsidies than renewables in Britain, and, as the
absence of the Tories from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6bJhKvFVw4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the climate debate</a> on Channel 4 highlighted, this
election is set to be a decisive one for the future of the Green New Deal in
Britain.</p>



<p><strong>EU:</strong> The European Union as a whole is well behind meeting the terms of the Paris Agreement, with leading states like Germany still <a href="https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/germanys-co2-emissions-set-fall-markedly-year-energy-use-declines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">locked into coal production</a> until 2038. On Thursday the European Parliament <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/28/eu-parliament-declares-climate-emergency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backed a Climate Emergency</a> and set a new target of 55 per cent emissions cut by 2030; still well short of what is required. </p>

<p>The Green New
Deal has started to pick up momentum as it has become clear that the EU’s
market based mechanisms, like the Emissions Trading Scheme, are <a href="https://corporateeurope.org/en/environment/2015/10/eu-emissions-trading-5-reasons-scrap-ets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">woefully
inadequate</a>.
The GND is posited as an alternative to the current ultra-low public investment
environment in the Eurozone, with the currency union’s perverse fiscal rules
acting to suppress employment in the Southern European economies in particular.
</p>



<p>But while the
GND is increasingly talked up across the European left, the mechanism by which
it is brought about is divided between pan-European solutions, advocated for
instance by <a href="https://diem25.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/170212_DiEM25_END_Summary_EN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yanis
Varoufakis’ DIEM25</a>, and a return to the nation-state, with <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/05/europe-ecosocialism-green-new-deal-labour-melenchon-podemos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jean-Luc Mélenchon</a> among the leading proponents of a
radical reform of the Eurozone, and failing that a ‘Plan B’ of unilateral
exit.&nbsp; The European Commission is set to
unveil a ‘European Green Deal’ plan on 11 December, but an <a href="https://www.climatechangenews.com/2019/11/29/leak-reveals-brussels-draft-plan-european-green-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early leaked
draft</a>
suggests a lack of hard numbers is a concern as to how solid it is, though a
commitment to review “the
state aid guidelines for environment and energy” is more promising.</p>



<p>The case of the Yellow Vests movement in France shows where green politics can go wrong if it is devoid of a radical agenda and instead seeks to pin the costs on those whose standard of living is already being squeezed. Macron scrapped a wealth tax and replaced it with a tax on fuel to fund green investment. That policy did not last the protests against it and much more, which still rumble on to this day, but in the critique of Emmanuel Macron’s greenwashing and the challenge to inequality, there are <a href="https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/the-yellow-vests-uncertain-future" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commonalities which can be found</a> between the Yellow Vests and GND advocates.</p>

<p><strong>10 things the
Green New Deal movement should do &#8211; and 10 things it shouldn’t</strong></p>



<p>How do we go
forward from here? While every place has its own political conditions to
consider, drawing from international experience there are a number of definite
do’s and do not’s that activists should consider. </p>



<p><strong>1) Demand
performance &#8211; not targets</strong></p>



<p>Talk is cheap,
and letting politicians talk about climate targets is letting them off the
hook. It’s the easiest thing in the world for a leader to talk about an
ambitious target in ten or 20 years time as they don’t have to take the tough
decision to deliver it. We need to be clear that ambitious targets does not
make any nation a ‘world leader’ &#8211; only ambitious actions in the here and now
can do that. </p>



<p>The Green New
Deal movement should not waste one more second talking about targets; we should
demand detailed plans for implementation, and exacting timescales to go with
those plans. And the start date on the plans must be now.</p>



<p>2) <strong>Be
collectivist &#8211; not individualist</strong> </p>



<p>Bernie Sanders
slogan <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K9xin37qgw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">‘not me, us’</a> should be the slogan of the Green
New Deal movement worldwide. We need to imbue political culture with a new
collective spirit and sense of common purpose, and the Green New Deal is the
perfect idea with which to do that. </p>



<p>There should be
no truck with those who would seek to force the movement down the alienating,
doomed-to-fail route of individual consumer choices. Not only is that a
terrible approach to addressing a collective problem, it’s also morally
dubious. We have government to establish a collective set of laws which govern
the limits of our individual actions; that’s what it exists for. There’s
absolutely no reason why we should all accept the need for laws when it comes
to, for instance, food standards and workplace health &amp; safety, but not for
ecological sustainability.</p>



<p>3) <strong>Be
positive &#8211; not miserable </strong></p>



<p>I writethis
is as someone prone toapocalyptic doom-mongering &#8211; it’s not helpful,
it’s not appealing and it’s not effective.Everywhere that the Green New
Deal is taking off as an idea it is because it is being led by people with a
positive story to tell about how not only can we save the world, but we can
make all of our lives better in the process. </p>



<p>That’s why while
there is a need to reduce global economic output, it is better to couch that in
the language of ‘better’, rather than ‘smaller’. And that’s not misleading
either &#8211; while we need less cars, we also need healthier cities that are more
enjoyable to live in. Both things are true, it’s a question of which one you
choose to emphasise. </p>



<p><strong>4) Be
unilateralist &#8211; not multilateralist </strong></p>



<p>The Paris
Agreement should have taught us that even if agreements are reached at a global
level, unless they can be enforced at national level they are meaningless.</p>



<p>There’s a whole
circuit of well-intentioned NGO’s, academics and journalists who are waiting
for the next UN Climate Summit, thinking this will finally be the one to get
climate action moving. And national leaders love the international summits
because it makes them feel like super-heroes. But they are not, and the summits
rarely lead to anything serious on the ground for a reason &#8211; they don’t
actually exercise a lot of power. Multilateralism on climate action is a bit
like multilateralism on nuclear weapons abolition&nbsp; &#8211; useless.</p>



<p>No more waiting.
If international institutions push forward then great, but the action of the
Green New Deal movement needs to be locally and nationally focused. Think
global, act local &#8211; and national.</p>



<p><strong>5) Be
socialist &#8211; not capitalist</strong></p>



<p>Capitalist
enterprises and the markets they operate in are structurally incapable of
delivering the Green New Deal. They simply are not set-up for the sort of
long-term, large-scale, cross-sector action that is needed to decarbonise the
economy. Just as the moon-landing and Britain’s war economy in fighting the
Nazis could have only been done on the basis of massive, co-ordinated state
planning, so it is for the Green New Deal. </p>



<p>To put it in a
more practical way, think about this. In the UK we have the highest proportion
of non-renewable heating in Europe; more than 90 per cent of heating is through
natural gas. Heating along with transport is where most emissions are now
coming from. In the space of a decade the UK needs to replace tens of millions
of gas boilers with zero-carbon options. House-by-house solutions like air
source heat pumps simply can not be efficiently done at that scale, speed and
with adequate reliability. The only way to do this is enormously expensive,
requires a mammoth co-ordination of resources and labour to the task, and means
carrying out infrastructure instalments largely on a district, rather than
house-by-house, basis. Capitalist markets can’t solve our heating emissions
problem in a decade. Only socialism can. Full stop.</p>



<p><strong>6) Be concrete
&#8211; not abstract</strong></p>



<p>The Green New
Deal movement has to start being precise with its demands. Politicians like to
get away with abstract sloganeering if they are allowed to, but we need to
force them to be exacting. Take the district heating example cited above &#8211; we
do not currently have the skilled workforce to carry out this scale of
infrastructure change in the timescale required. So what is our government
doing to train more plumbers and electricians? How is it co-ordinating them? Is
it sourcing the piping material? How many houses is it going to do per year? </p>



<p>The challenge
with concreteness is getting round the short-termism of politics, which
operates to an electoral cycle and is motivated not by getting things done but
by capturing headlines. The trick is to generate headlines <em>around</em>
concrete demands. </p>



<p><strong>7) Break the
rules &#8211; don’t bend to the rules</strong></p>



<p>The current set
of rules for how economies are governed is not fit for purpose in an era of
multiple ecological crisis. As a <a href="https://www.commonspace.scot/articles/13217/scientists-state-led-planning-not-markets-only-hope-preventing-planetary-climate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UN report</a> by a group of Finnish academics put
it, the “dominant
economic theories, approaches, and models…were developed during the era of
energetic and material abundance”.</p>



<p>In that context,
it is irresponsible to limit the horizons of a Green New Deal to that which is
within the constraints of national and international rules which act to thwart
effective climate action. The EU’s rules on state aid, fiscal limits and ‘free’
movement of capital and goods, for instance, are a barrier to a Green New Deal.
Regardless of whether states are in or outside the EU, these rules must be
broken if rapid progress is to be made. Equally, Scottish political leaders
should not restrict themselves only to areas of devolved competence. Climate
action should be directed by need, not rules &#8211; let London and Brussels try to
stop us, rather than using their rules as an excuse for our inaction.</p>



<p><strong>8) Be universal
&#8211; not sectional</strong></p>



<p>All the great
movements of history have had a universal message and have not been afraid to
think big, and in so doing seizing the terrain of ‘freedom’ and ‘justice’ and
making it their own. The Civil Rights movement and <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/i-have-a-dream-speech-text_n_809993" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Martin Luther
King</a> are
good examples of this. King fought for the rights of an oppressed minority, but
he did so by speaking to universal values and interests, and envisioning a new
world which all would benefit from. </p>



<p>In Nelson
Mandela’s famous ‘I am prepared to die’ speech, which was in substance a 3-hour
long case for the sabotage of the property of the white supremacists, he
appealed to a global, universal audience, when he argued: “I have fought
against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. I have
cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all people will
live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal for which
I hope to live for and to see realised.”</p>



<p>The Green New
Deal must not be pidgeon-holed as a movement only of the young, or only of the
cosmopolitan. Part of the point of a movement is to overcome narrow, sectional
interests and partisan political divides, and instead make a claim to speak for
society as a whole.</p>



<p><strong>9) Reach
outside the bubble</strong></p>



<p>The Green New
Deal movement cannot be a Twitter phenomenon. Neither can it comfort itself
with speaking to rooms full of the converted. It needs to get offline, and get
out of university cities. The Green New Deal movement can have a message that
speaks to people concerned about run-down town centres, about crap jobs, about
a lack of decent public transport, but not if it is talking to itself. </p>



<p>Again, Bernie
Sanders provides a decent template here. His presidential campaign has
explicitly sought to reach outside the bubble. This video of Sanders getting a
big cheer at a Fox News organised town hall debate is a good example of
bridging divides and knocking down barriers. </p>



<figure><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DV60Q8-B808" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315"></iframe></figure>



<p>The forces which
have constituted the Yellow Vests, what Christophe Guilluy calls <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/02/france-is-deeply-fractured-gilets-jeunes-just-a-symptom?fbclid=IwAR0Zfl97bHrL9k5BYInFWvt5PysznFM3WDpjg5RHucgEDhABAXD6fWj05Ps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“peripheral
France”</a> &#8211;
those living in rural areas and are increasingly marginalised and alienated &#8211;
need to be a target constituency for the Green New Deal movement to win over. </p>



<p><strong>10) Build
unity &#8211; but with a purpose</strong></p>



<p>Every successful
movement manages to balance two competing pressures &#8211; co-option and exclusion.
If a movement becomes co-opted by Establishment forces, it loses its purpose.
This is an obvious concern for the Green New Deal, with governments that have
no intention of making a serious Green New Deal happen already using the language
to communicate its climate policies. Avoiding co-option requires having
concrete demands.</p>



<p>But another
danger is exclusion. A campaign can have the perfect Green New Deal programme,
but if it doesn’t involve a large section of people who are in favour of
climate action, then it’s not really a movement. A wide coalition can and
should be built in favour of the Green New Deal. </p>



<p>So the trick is
to build unity &#8211; but with a purpose. Bring as wide a group of people on board
(no matter your divisions on other issues) but do so on the basis of fighting
for clear demands. AOC’s Green New Deal Bill, which she is trying to get
Republicans as well as Democrats on board with, is an example of the sort of
unity with a purpose that can be built. </p>
