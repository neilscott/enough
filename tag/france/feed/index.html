<p><em>This is the first in a series of articles reflecting on the last three weeks traveling for the Enough Routes programme. <a href="https://www.enough.scot/2019/10/10/acting-out/">Gehan Macleod</a> describes time spent helping out at two expressions of migrant solidarity at Calais and Ventimiglia.</em></p>



<p><strong>Ventimiglia</strong></p>



<p>Language can be limited in situations when
people speak Arabic in many dialects; Kurdish; French; borrowed Italian,
English learned through nursery rhymes related by an earnest school teacher in
some time that is now far away. A time that must feel further away as geography
and events displace <em>now</em> from <em>then</em>, displaced you from the lands
of your home. And yet the language of emotion across a face is universal; eyes
lit by mobiles and fierce joy while on calls to loved ones &#8211; familiar faces and
tones conjured up on small screens, enough light to scatter the darkness
momentarily. Moments that chase away the shadows of despair, or past and recent
traumas that stir emotions – emotions that cannot be allowed to smother hope. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ventimmiglia-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8081" srcset="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ventimmiglia-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ventimmiglia-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ventimmiglia-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ventimmiglia-585x439.jpg 585w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ventimmiglia-1170x878.jpg 1170w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ventimmiglia-100x75.jpg 100w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ventimmiglia.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>It is a hope that compelled those I meet at the
roadside close to the border between Italy and France, to set off and leave all
that was familiar behind with loved ones, if war or unrest hadn’t taken them. </p>



<p>Hope that new places might obliterate loss. </p>



<p>Hope that new lands might offer asylum from torment
and repression. </p>



<p>Hope that has kept them moving on. </p>



<p>Through darkness. </p>



<p>Through danger. </p>



<p>Through miles and miles of strange land, strange
towns and strange glances. </p>



<p>Through borders when chance allowed. Hope that somewhere they might find the ‘better life’ sold to them and tens of thousands of others leaning in to flickering images of the West, transmitted into homes everywhere – neoliberal ideals of success brought to life by cathode ray tubes or perhaps liquid crystal. An empty promise they have come to call <em>the big lie</em>; <em>“</em>we now know Europe is a big lie” they say. Yet they cannot afford to let these thoughts cross their brow for more than a moment. Hope is all they have left – a marker that all they’ve endured has been for some end. </p>



<p>The talk soon returns to what opportunities might lie just beyond <em>that</em> horizon and plans for how to cross it. Their chat is interspersed with stories from their journeys to get to where they’re standing now. Humorous recounting of Bond-style attempts to cross borders; along live train tracks, furtive attempts to escape capture – something to pit your wits against, to display the kind of ingenuity and perseverance rewarded in other circles. Other times experiences of hardship related with a shudder, or encounters with ruthless smugglers.</p>

<p>Language can be limited and what can I convey
that a thousand articles in a hundred publications haven’t conveyed already? The
so-called migrant crisis must have been covered by tens of thousands of words
in print and broadcasts. We know that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_migrant_crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 2015 the situation</a> has worsened. Yet <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/24/it-could-have-been-me-refugees-describe-their-journeys-to-the-uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">individual stories</a> are made and remade
every day. Small snatches of the stories of the 31 men and eight women found
dead in a container in Essex have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/24/essex-lorry-deaths-39-victims-were-chinese-nationals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made the headlines</a>. But there are many
more stories unfolding as I write this (as you read it). What can I truthfully
say to Mohammed and Mûrtha searching my face for hope, for some kind of answer?
Do I agree that there will be a good-paying job waiting for them in a UK free
from racism? Or do I risk undermining that precious hope they have? I want to
offer answers, affirm their sense of hope. I want to see some way to have hope
myself &#8211; that this situation could be overturned, if not for these guys, for
those who will otherwise come after them. But it all feels so overwhelmingly
wrong and fucked up. With no answers and no other way to feel I can do
something, I sink my arms into cauldron-like cooking pots and scrub. I sort
wood sheds. I peel carrots. I chop onions at the makeshift kitchen in the
mountains of <a href="https://keshaniya.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kesha Niya</a> – Surani Kurdish for ‘No Problem’. Here, off
their own backs, they’ve been cooking a hot meal every day for around 100
displaced people for the past few years. They are supported by <a href="https://www.roya-citoyenne.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roya Citoyenne</a>, an association that promotes “intercommunality” in nearby Roya. They
transport and serve the food about 40 minutes drive away in an unused car park in
<a href="https://www.redpepper.org.uk/the-deadly-border-politics-of-ventimiglia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ventimiglia</a>, on the Italian
Riviera. They’ve seen times when the numbers have swelled to 600 or more. The
night we are there it’s dark and around eighty guys line up next to a flyover for
a hot meal dished up by the small crew of volunteers. Others will have found
refuge in the Red Cross camp nearby, a place many will not go as entry requires
being fingerprinted; a process that can prevent applications for asylum
elsewhere in Europe.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="768" height="1024" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kesha-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8083" srcset="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kesha-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kesha-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kesha-585x780.jpg 585w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kesha-100x133.jpg 100w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kesha.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<p>About 5 miles away, by the side of the road, the
same small group offer an all-day resting place to those pushed back from the
French-Italian border, just a few hundred feet further down the road. They
offer fresh food, hot coffee and water, somewhere to charge mobiles and advice
to the 80 to 100 or more people a day who were stopped trying to walk past
police at the border. The unlucky are those detained in containers overnight and
not released until 4 p.m. the following day – without food or water. These guys
drink long from the plastic water cans balanced on a low roadside wall. Kesha
Niya have self-organised this resting place for around two years – every day
since last May. They record and compile data: where people have travelled from,
which routes they’ve taken, women or minors travelling alone, as well as
incidents of illegal or ill treatment at the border<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>.
They have seen an increase in French police turning away young adults (still
legally children), who they are supposed to guarantee protection to. They do so
by falsifying their date of birth on the papers they issue to them; dates that
are obviously false, such as 01/01/2000. They are particularly concerned about
the use of the containers. The facilities at the border do not allow for
detention &#8211; the French police are only legally supposed to detain people for
the purposes of confirming their identity. Given the recent find in Essex, this
is a particularly chilling development. The day I left, there were reportedly
30-50 guys who were detained between 3 containers arranged to form a courtyard.
Pepper spray was used and when this triggered an epileptic fit, there were only
half-hearted attempts to offer medical support, while other officers looked on
and laughed. Another man showed police his medical papers to demonstrate his
need for diabetic medication and was met with a similar response. A Moroccan
migrant captured some of this on his phone. The organisers are not hopeful
about exerting pressure that would persuade the French police to ensure they operate
within the law.</p>



<p><strong>Calais</strong></p>



<p>Many of the guys passing Ventimiglia are heading
for Calais. When I left there earlier in the week, French police were in the
process of evicting some of the sites surrounding the port, where we were told there
are currently around 700 displaced people encamped. There have been <a href="https://helprefugees.org/news/the-calais-jungle-three-years-on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 1,300 recorded evictions</a> since the
world-renowned <em>Jungle</em> was evicted in 2016 – on 24 October, exactly three
years ago the day I arrive there. There are a number of organisations there in
solidarity with existing refugees and the new migrants arriving daily. Not just
well-established NGOs but spontaneous groups like <a href="https://helprefugees.org/latest-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Help Refugees</a> and <a href="http://www.refugeecommunitykitchen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Refugee Community Kitchen</a>; citizen-led responses to the very real situation
displaced people find themselves in &#8211; a direct expression of solidarity and
mutual aid. These groups are filling gaping chasms left by European governments
whose immigration policies are woefully inadequate in response to the
challenges posed by migration. It’s not hard to see the ‘migrant crisis’, a
term worthy of critical reflection, was at least worsened, if not created by
their own foreign policies and other international interventions variously
motivated or by the climate change that has been one of the deadly costs of
Europe’s wealth.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="768" height="1024" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/thumbnail-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8084" srcset="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/thumbnail.jpg 768w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/thumbnail-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/thumbnail-585x780.jpg 585w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/thumbnail-100x133.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<p>Since 2015, RCK have been cooking and distributing 1200-1500 hot meals a day to displaced people camped around Calais and Dunkirk. It’s an effort impressive in scale and delivered with expertise and care on minimal resources. An effort made only more impressive by the self-organisation the place runs on; decisions are made collectively through daily meetings. It was there, while washing more pots and preparing veg &#8211; that I found out about the group in Ventimiglia. RCK cook from 9 a.m., distributions start mid-afternoon and they work until past 7 p.m. and like Kesha Niya, these efforts are entirely driven by volunteers, many of whom are informed, compassionate young people looking for an immediate means to make some difference in a world they’ve inherited. One young woman travels down from studying for a degree in International Relations at Edinburgh Uni to help out here. She says she can’t wait until she has graduated so she can be here longer, although she’s still trying to figure out how to support herself to do so. She says she loves meeting the people out on distribution; getting to know familiar faces but she also mentions how the self-organising works for her. It seems the streamlined operation is the result of many people’s expertise and creativity &#8211; problem solving together to make things flow more smoothly. </p>



<p>She feels her contributions are not only welcome but useful. They were also able to absorb significant numbers of new volunteers and very quickly have them on a useful task. Here people are working long hours for no pay and the atmosphere borders on festival-like at times; loud tunes pump out and a disco light pulsates over the huge pots of curry cooking. It’s also clear that a ton of relevant expertise has landed and informed the running of the place in ways that just make sense – I’m there during the weekly deep clean that would put a professional kitchen to shame. I mention this as there’s something that strikes me that relates to John Holloway’s ‘doing’ as distinct from alienated labour<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> and Illich’s autonomous action that are important in <em>acting out</em>, of finding ways to degrow and regrow, of adapting to crisis. </p>



<p><strong>Language of limits</strong></p>



<p>When I was packing, I grabbed a couple of thin books to keep baggage down. One was Illich’s <em>Right to Useful Unemployment</em>. Somehow whenever I open Illich I find something that hits the nail squarely on the head. Crisis, he says, has become an indicator that experts must step in while normal liberties are suspended &#8211; a perversion from Greek roots that suggested ‘choices’ or ‘turning points’. He insists it could mean “the marvellous moment when people suddenly become aware of their self-imposed cages and the possibility of a different life.” Michael Dunn’s description of the migrant crisis as <a href="https://edgeryders.eu/t/mobile-independent-clinic/827" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a training ground</a> for other forms of crisis, was the first time I’d come across this perspective. At both Calais and Ventimiglia this was evident. In the face of unimaginable precarity and risk, it was impossible not be to impressed and deeply moved by the quiet dignity of the guys I met, whose grasp on hope and a heavy sense of humour kept them going. Those who’ve left all that is familiar in the hope of safety from oppression, war or unrest or simply a better way of life – have something massive to teach about starting out on the arduous but critical degrowth journeys I believe we must all begin. </p>



<p>We need to leave much that we’ve built behind; status, professional reputations and the stuff we’ve accumulated and venture into unfamiliar territories contoured by new assumptions on which we can found more generative cultures and more compassionate ways of being. There are personal journeys to be made that require us to get damn good at crossing borders. Traversing ideological borders; conversing beyond the increasingly polarised spaces that now make up our society. Perhaps more than anything though, <em>crossing the borders we create with our minds</em>; the inner language of limits that reflects outer limits we impose as we inhabit spaces prescribed by borders reinforced and policed by our social conditioning<em>, </em>the endless ways we comply with narratives or societal practices that are not serving us, humanity or the planet.Prescribed lives lived within limits so as to comply with economic growth and free markets that know no limits. How often when we discuss imposing limits on growth, do we conflate that with imposing limits on self – as if growth <em>is</em> us? Sure personal choices and consumer behaviour are bound up in the issue. But it is not the same. It is not transactional. When we cease to live within limits in this sense, when we act outwith these borders we start to language new possibilities, new forms of dialoguing with others and the world, and find new ways to be in solidarity with one another. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="768" height="1024" src="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sleepbags-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8087" srcset="https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sleepbags-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sleepbags-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sleepbags-585x780.jpg 585w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sleepbags-100x133.jpg 100w, https://www.enough.scot/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sleepbags.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<p>A favourite quote of mine is from the Aboriginal
activist Lilla Watson who suggests; </p>



<p>“<em>if
you have come here to help me – you are wasting your time. If you have come
because your liberation is bound up with mine, then let us work together.</em>” </p>



<p>It describes perfectly the difference in power
relation bound up in charity as distinct from solidarity. I saw in these
citizen-led, self-initiated responses to the migrant crisis, training grounds where
people were working together in ways that recover our collective liberation.
Acts that go beyond transactional offers of charity. Training grounds for
acting outwith the status quo, beyond the mediated experiences of consumer
society, where transactional ways of relating form a radical monopoly on too
much of our lives; how we vote, how we meet our needs, how we offer compassion.
Here people are learning another way of responding – beyond campaigning, beyond
donations, beyond petitions and beyond governments or NGOs. A way of responding
that is immediate, founded in mutual aid and rooted in self-organising. Direct
responses to another individual’s situation – hard to imagine compassion more
radical than that. Powerful lessons in building the kind of bottom-up
counterpower I believe is called for in bringing about the order of change
essential both for degrowth or deep adaptation. These are the spaces where we
prefigure new ways of being, new manners of organising society, engage in the life-giving
business of Holloway’s <em>doing</em>. These are the experiences that once tasted
are never lost. That I tasted at spaces like Pollok Free State. That the
student from Edinburgh has tasted at the Refugee Community Kitchen.
Countercultural spaces we will continue to seek out because on some level we
know there is something more essential to our human beingness that we find there.
Countercultural spaces that can generate a wider culture that supports new
expressions of society and humanity in the face of the current crisis-cluster. </p>



<p>Migrant solidarity is evidently a clear area around which people are self-organising and ‘acting out’; the kind of citizen-led responses I set out to find. I wonder about the scale of this response &#8211; it would be interesting to map this kind of activity, if someone hasn’t done so already. Although it’s also true that those I’ve visited are small in comparison to the sheer numbers of displaced peoples passing through Europe. And then I’m reminded of another quote &#8211; by the German poet Rilke; <br><br>“<em>Again and again in history some people wake up. They have no ground in the crowd and move to broader deeper laws. They carry strange customs with them and demand room for bold and audacious action. The future speaks ruthlessly through them.</em>”<br> The language of the future knows no limits, other than those we create ourselves. <br></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The whole world stopped to watch and mourn the reports on the Amazon fires, which were immediately mistaken for forest fires due to global warming, but were actually man-made. After the true origin of the fires came to light, many blamed the Bolsonaro government&#8217;s inability for the situation, as, since taking office in January, the retired militarian has defended the expansion of agribusiness in the Amazon, even at the expense of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights. Further perpetuating Brazil&#8217;s eternal image as a colony of exploration no matter the cost to indigenous peoples lives and the environment, international capital was exempted from the situation.<br></p>



<p>The Amazon has been explored and destroyed for a long time, and much of that destruction has been done for the enrichment of corporations in the northern hemisphere.</p>



<p>In August 2019, according to <a href="http://queimadas.dgi.inpe.br/queimadas/aq1km/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data</a> from the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), Amazon fires burned 29,944 km² of the biome, which is the equivalent of 4.2 million football fields. The burned territory is more than four times larger than in August 2018, when 6,048 km² were burned. Altogether, the Amazon has 5.5 million km², of which 4.19 million km² are located in Brazilian territory. Behind the clearing of the forest and fire are powerful economic interests: cattle ranching, illegal timber trade and soy production. Some of these products are ultimately destined for the European Union (EU).<br></p>



<p>After China, <a href="http://apib.info/files/2019/05/Cumplicidade_Na_Destrui%C3%A7%C3%A3o.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the EU is Brazil&#8217;s second largest trading partner</a>, accounting for 18.3% of its trade. Most imports from the EU are primary products; Brazil exports more agricultural commodities to the EU than any other buyer. In 2018, 41% of EU beef imports came from Brazil. As the EU negotiates with Mercosur members &#8211; including Brazil &#8211; to remove trade barriers through a free trade agreement with these countries, large Brazilian agribusiness companies exporting to the EU could also benefit from new opportunities with the bloc. The EU therefore, plays a key role in ensuring that its trade policies safeguard the Amazon and the rights of its inhabitants. Additionally, the EU has repeatedly stressed the importance of addressing Brazil&#8217;s socio-environmental crisis, requiring European negotiators to emphasise these issues under a new agreement.<br></p>



<p>French President Emmanuel Macron called the fires an “<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/amazon-fires-brazil-jair-bolsonaro-emmanuel-macron-rainforest-g7-summit-a9075681.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">international crisis</a>,” a statement that was interpreted by Bolsonaro as a “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/27/jair-bolsonaro-demands-emmanuel-macron-withdraw-insults-over-fires" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personal affront</a>” and understood to be a threat about buying Brazilian products, whilst also causing fear among companies in both blocs. At no time was the agreement between Mercosur and the EU put in check. The international market&#8217;s relationship with the fires is not simple; Europe has purchased products that have been leaving illegally deforested areas for decades.<br></p>



<p>Multinational cooperation attempts to minimise the ecocide have already been made. In response to the climate crisis in 2007, the creation of the Amazon Fund was announced during <a href="https://redd-monitor.org/2019/07/12/norway-and-brazils-negotiations-about-the-amazon-fund-are-ignoring-the-failure-to-address-the-drivers-of-deforestation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COP-13</a> (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change). The fund was established the following year under Lula’s administration and the program emerged as a pioneer initiative to raise funds from the countries of the Northern Hemisphere to maintain the largest rainforest in the world, thus helping to combat climate change. The Amazon Fund has already become the main Brazilian instrument for funding environmental protection actions, monitoring and combating deforestation, as well as promoting the conservation and sustainable use of the Amazon biome. Its resources currently support 103 projects by state governments and civil society to protect the forest, including the Amazon Protected Areas program.<br></p>



<p>The implementation of the Amazon Fund was prepared by the Ministry of Environment and is administered by the National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES). Since the start of its operation, <a href="https://redd-monitor.org/2019/07/12/norway-and-brazils-negotiations-about-the-amazon-fund-are-ignoring-the-failure-to-address-the-drivers-of-deforestation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Norway has been by far the largest donor</a> (94%), followed by Germany (5%) and Petrobras (1%).<br></p>



<p>The Amazon Fund is at risk of extinction due to disagreements between donor nations and the current Brazilian government over two main points: resource allocation and governance. This was exemplified when Minister of Environment, Ricardo Salles announced his intention to compensate landowners &#8211; from the Amazon Fund &#8211;&nbsp; who were expropriated for being located within protected areas as required by the Forest Code.<br></p>



<p>Norway and Germany are opposed to changing the rules of the Amazon Fund, which currently does not allow the use of money to pay expropriation compensation. Environmentalists fear that the use of resources for land tenure regularisation in the Amazon, would benefit those who invaded the protected areas of the forest and generate even more deforestation.<br></p>



<p>Even though Norway was the largest donor to the Amazon Fund, the country is far from respecting of the environment in Brazil. The Norwegian government is the main shareholder of mining company, Norsk Hydro, which is the <a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2018/02/norsk-hydro-accused-of-amazon-toxic-spill-admits-clandestine-pipeline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subject of complaints</a> in the Pará Federal Prosecutor&#8217;s Office (MPF). Of all lawsuits, 3% are against the Norwegian government, charged of contaminating rivers and communities with heavy metals in the municipality of Barcarena, 40 kilometers from Belem. The region is one of the most polluted in the Amazon rainforest due to unbridled industrial growth.<br></p>



<p>Indigenous, Quilombolas and other traditional populations who have the right to use their legally protected ancestral lands continue to fight bravely against the attacks. Jair Bolsonaro&#8217;s neo-colonialist mindset, coupled with the nefarious interests of multinational corporations considers the mere existence of the indigenous as an act of defiance against the establishment. On August 13th, around 2,000 women from 110 different indigenous ethnicities of Brazil gathered in the capital, Brasilia, for the <a href="https://www.amazonfrontlines.org/chronicles/indigenous-women-march-brazil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1st March of Indigenous Women</a>. United around the theme “Territory: our body, our spirit”, they’ve marched against Bolsonaro’s government and in defense of the demarcation of indigenous lands, which though recognised by the constitution, has been questioned and challenged by the new government. The march of indigenous women was organised by Articulation of Indigenous People of Brazil (Apib), a national association of entities representing indigenous people. The same association in partnership with the Amazon Watch, produced a report called <a href="http://apib.info/files/2019/05/2019-complicity-in-destruction-2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Complicity in Destruction</a>.<br></p>



<p>The report identifies and examines the business transactions of Brazilian companies behind the 2017-2019 increase in illegal deforestation and tracks their links to European, US and Canadian companies. The results provide information on the role of foreign economic agents in driving agroindustrial expansion in tropical forests. The Complicity in Destruction report is set against the backdrop of a growing trend of land invasions in Brazil, with indigenous peoples and other rural communities reporting a dramatic increase in conflicts arising from efforts to expand plantations and cattle ranches on their lands.<br></p>



<p>Complicity in Destruction analysed fines issued by the Brazilian Institute Of The Environment And Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) since 2017 for illegal deforestation committed by 56 Brazilian companies that have been linked to European and North American companies cited.<br></p>



<p>Additionally, the report identified 27 commodity importers and traders doing business with Brazilian companies. It also unveiled a series of financial connections between dozens of top-tier international financial institutions and Brazil&#8217;s leading refrigerator companies and major global commodity traders who distribute soy to global markets.<br></p>



<p>In short, <a href="http://apib.info/files/2019/05/2019-complicity-in-destruction-2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Complicity in Destruction</a> reveals the significant role of individual foreign actors, whether they are commodity buyers or financial institutions financing the activities that are fueling deforestation in Brazil, and the genocide of indigenous peoples.<br></p>



<p>The Brazilian government should not be exempted from blame, after all this was orchestrated by them. However, we should be careful not to fall into traps which reproduce colonialist discourses and which question the sovereignty of the Amazon, as proposed by some countries. We should also be aware of the people who profit the most of this crime, are the people who are far away from Brazil.<br></p>
