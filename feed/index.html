<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>&#8211;  application deadline extended to 30th August! &#8211;</strong><br><br><strong>2023 online and residential course<br>17th October &#8211; 9th December 2023<br></strong><br>An invitation to take part in a participatory, transformative learning programme for social and environmental practitioners, (post)activists, change-makers and everyone else interested in exploring ideas and practices for economies of care, solidarity, belonging and social and ecological justice within planetary limits. The programme combines online sessions over seven weeks with a four day residential learning retreat at Whatton Lodge, Gullane, East Lothian. It is delivered jointly by Enough! Scotland and the <a href="https://www.che.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Centre for Human Ecology</a>.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Key components of the course:</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">• Weekly online sessions: Tuesdays 7pm &#8211; 9pm, Oct 17th – Dec 5th 2023</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">• A residential learning retreat and field trip, <a href="https://whattonlodge.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whatton Lodge, Gullane</a>, Nov 16th-20th</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">• Co-learning lab and gathering, 9th Dec (Central Scotland, venue tbc) : final event with sharing of participants’ learning</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">• Self-directed study: through a course handbook, online resources and a practice-based inquiry / study / creative exploration.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">• At least three additional peer group meetings will be held over the period of the course (times to be agreed by participants)</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Description</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In times marked by accelerating climate breakdown, and social ad economic volatility, uncertainty and complexity, the knowledge and skills required to understand and navigate the metacrisis call for new forms of education and community.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We will explore together where we are now, how we got here, and what we can do about it. DE/GROWTH means engaging with the framing and literature on degrowth: new economic thinking in response to biophysical limits &#8211; such as redistribution of resources, work and, global solidarity &#8211; while drawing on the deep roots of human ecology to explore belonging in relation to communities of place, climate justice and ecological sustainability.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">During the course, together we’ll create a collaborative learning community around the core themes, and create ripples to embed principles and practices of degrowth and human ecology among community and climate activists across Scotland. We draw upon methods taken from popular education practice, building on a rich heritage of radical pedagogy.<br></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Residential</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The residential takes place at Whatton Lodge, Gullane, East Lothian, home of Lothian Mineworkers Convalescent Home Trust, which was set-up in 1948 to provide breaks and respite for ex-miners and their families after serious accidents or illness. Situated by the Gullane sand dunes, with a gate to the beach, the home of this year’s residential offers a beautiful and comfortable setting for learning, as well as a suitable venue to reflect on the meaning and memory of deindustrialisation in Scotland and its legacy of extractivism and inequality, which will be explored in the course content.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The residential is a transformative learning community in microcosm: designed to complement the online sessions with in-person collaboration and cooperation around the learning content and other group activities. It has four main components: learning sessions exploring human ecology, degrowth, the solidarity economy, and regenerative cultures, guided experiences engaging with land/waterscapes and each other,: peer groups meeting to discuss and inquire into their questions together, open space where participants self-organise sessions around specific topics or activities: and place-based learning from the community and bioregion. And no residential is complete without a self-organised ceilidh!<br><br>Please note that travel to and from the residential must be met by participants individually. If these are a barrier, please let us know when completing the application form below and we may be able to support your travel.<br></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Who is the course for?</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">People normally based in (or with a connection to) Scotland who are active in their community and/or activist groups and keen to learn with like-minded peers. We encourage those who may not ordinarily have opportunities to take part in a course like this and will aim to accommodate barriers you may have to participating. Please get in touch and let us know if there is anything which might prevent you from taking part.<br></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>What you need to commit to:</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We are making the course available for all to participate in, regardless of finances, but this does not mean that it is &#8216;free&#8217; in an absolute sense. There is no charge for the course as it is fully funded by Enough! Scotland. However, delivering this course requires resources, labour and money; and places are limited. So please only apply for a place on the course if you can reasonably expect to be able to fully participate in all components for the duration of the course. The course comprises of 7 two-hour online workshops (delivered via Zoom), a four day residential, and an online virtual learning environment in which course readings and resources, and discussion threads are accessed.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As part of the course, participants will be asked to conduct a personal action inquiry into a question of their choosing related to the course themes, and to share the results of this inquiry with the course cohort in the final session, in whichever format/ creative medium they choose (for example, a poster presentation, a text, talk, artwork, or workshop). This will comprise a Co-Learning Lab and gathering on the 9<sup>th</sup> December 2023, in which the knowledge created during the course will be shared more widely.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Participants, upon completing the course, will be eligible to receive a Certificate of Completion. As part of our ongoing inquiry into co-operative and alternative economic practices, participants will have the opportunity to explore ways to contribute to the course, and associated activity by means of knowledge exchange, skillsharing and collaboration. This includes the opportunity to contribute to the educational charitable work of the Centre for Human Ecology by making a one-off or regular financial contribution of the education co-operative via our <a href="https://opencollective.com/che/donate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenCollective platform</a>, 100% of which will go towards developing future educational work.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>How to apply:</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In order to apply, please complete a short form outlining why you would like to take part in the course. Our courses are generally oversubscribed, which means that we have to select participants. We select participants using the criteria of creating a diverse group of peer-learners based on the information you provide in the application form.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">To apply, please fill in the application form by Wednesday 30th August, 2023:</p>

<p><strong>Forms of traditional ecological knowledge that have been enacted since antiquity in Scotland are ripe for re-imagining.

Art by Megan Chapman. From #4 of <a href="https://www.enough.scot/less/">LESS a journal of degrowth, radical sufficiency and decolonisation</a>.</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I hear the storm. They talk to me about progress, about ‘achievements’; diseases cured, improved standards of living. I am talking about societies drained of their essence, cultures trampled underfoot, institutions undermined, lands confiscated, religions smashed, magnificent artistic creations destroyed, extraordinary possibilities wiped out.” – Aimé Césaire, <em>Discourse on Colonialism</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ever since hearing it a few years ago, I’ve been haunted by what I take to be a very important statistic. Whilst making up just 5% of the world’s population, Indigenous peoples protect and steward 80% of global biodiversity. Indigenous peoples have generally managed to co-exist in relative balance with the environments they inhabit, and which they, more often than not, see themselves as a part of. For those of us who are not among this 5%, this statistic forces us to ask if there’s a need to learn, or indeed relearn, how to live with the rest of the more-than-human world in ways that resemble how Indigenous peoples do.</p>



<p>The question that has been preoccupying me over the past couple years is what could this mean here, in Scotland, or more specifically in the Highlands and Islands – the Gàidhealtachd? I’ll situate this consideration in and amongst the hotly debated, current, and divisive issue of rewilding and how it could relate to both repeopling and cultural revival.</p>



<p>But to start, I’ll begin with a plant: <em>Avena Strigosa</em> or Corc Beag – the small, bristle, grey oat. These oats, along with Bere Barley and Hebridean Rye, are the last remaining cereal landraces to be found in Scotland. A landrace can be defined as a “locally adapted variety of a domesticated species of plant (or animal) which over time has become well adapted to its local environmental conditions” (SASA, n.d.).<em> </em>Cultivated year in, year out for hundreds if not thousands of years, they exist today only in the Northern and Western Isles, areas which conventional wisdom might define as peripheral. Grown as fodder for livestock, the 540 hectares of Corc Beag grown annually on the Uists make up the largest area of surviving landraces anywhere in Britain (BSBI, 2010). In many ways it’s a miracle that they still exist at all.</p>



<p>Yet these were once the major food crops of the Gàidhealtachd. If you read the accounts from early travellers to the region, it becomes apparent quite how much grain was grown here in the past. When Martin Martin (1697) visited in 1695, grains seem to have been cultivated almost everywhere, often on places where today it would be very hard to believe it possible. In giving an account of Skye for the Board of Agriculture in 1811, James MacDonald reported that of the island’s total landmass of roughly 350,000 acres, 8.5% was used as arable land. MacDonald (1811: 209, 761) claims of Corc Beag that “this grain constitutes the bread of three-fourths of the population”, and, despite the population then being almost double what it is today, that the soils of Skye should be capable of being able to “supply their present population with bread.”</p>



<p>The volume of grain being produced was only possible because this arable system worked in tandem with another agricultural practice: the Shieling system. At its most basic, the Shieling system was a form of what is called transhumance – where people and livestock would move away, beyond the boundary, from the fertile low-lying glens or in-byes, and into the out-bye land or fàsachs, and up into the hills or onto the moors where they would spend long summer months living in the àirighs or shielings, herding and milking their livestock.</p>



<p>This was an agricultural system that in many ways also held much of Gaelic lifeway patterns and cultural norms together. By and large, the Gaelic calendar year was split into two halves: the season of growth that began with the celebrations of Beltane in early May; and the season of decay that was marked by Samhain at the end of October and was also understood to be the beginning of the Gaelic new year. These calendar dates where the markers for when the transhumance could begin and end, and both dates involved elaborate festivities and rituals. The significance of this seasonal movement to Gaelic culture was enormous, as attested to by the volume of songs and stories in the archives about the shielings and summer milking.</p>



<p>As well as providing the dairy products which, along with grain, made up the bulk of the traditional Gàidhealtachd diet, there is evidence that the Shieling system was beneficial to the land. When the early travellers reported on what they found they were often describing open-park like woodland habitats, heathland, and moorland. Numerous ecologists have commented that the impacts of cattle and other livestock, if done in the appropriate way and stocked at the right density, can be beneficial to woodland ecology and biodiversity.</p>



<p>According to Frank Fraser Darling (1956), possibly the foremost 20th century ecologist of the Highlands and Islands, “The cattle husbandry and persistence of the forests were reasonably compatible and even complementary, for the cattle received shelter from the forest and the trees benefited from light cropping of the herbage floor, from the browsing and the manuring.” Writing about traditional cattle in woodland ecology in the Highlands, conservationist Roy Dennis (1998: 7-8) observes, “There is increasing interest in understanding the effects of mega-herbivores on forest ecosystems in Europe and a growing scepticism that the primeval forests were dark woodlands of densely growing trees. Instead, it is believed that fire and the large herbivores created mosaics on both large and small scales, and that in some places there were open ‘savannah-like’ wooded grasslands. … Without cattle, our forest ecosystems will not be as successful for biodiversity conservation.”</p>



<p>Echoing this point, Knepp Estate (n.d.) in the South of England, one of the primary working examples of the so-called rewilding movement, affirms that “the battle between these two opposing forces of nature – animal disturbance and vegetation succession – generates habitat complexity and biodiversity. Reintroducing some of these animals to the landscape – using domestic descendants as proxies for some of the extinct species – can have a hugely positive impact on nature.” This was to a certain extent the type of habitat that the early travellers to the Gàidhealtachd were describing: mosaics of savannah like wood pasture at various stages of succession, achieved in ways that were still healthy and dynamic. By moving the livestock into the hills and grazing in a way that was, at least in part, beneficial to the ecology of the habitat, there was an elegant, well-balanced system which made full use of the agricultural territory.</p>



<p>The territories were places that people knew intimately, as evidenced by the plethora of place names found within the Gaelic heartlands. Almost every rock and little pool or stream would appear to have had a name. But, significantly, the people here also knew how to <em>use</em> the territory in ways that are hard to envisage today.</p>



<p>The naturalist Thomas Pennant (1774) famously visited the Hebrides in 1772 to report to his readers on what he had seen. To accompany him, Pennant had brought along the botanist Rev. John Lightfoot who compiled a 1,200 page botanical survey later published in 1777. Whilst this record is mostly made up of scientific descriptions of his findings, he also included many ethnobotanical notes on how these plants were used. I still need to give the book more attention, but having gone through it I’ve found that Lightfoot noted uses for an astonishing 274 wild plants, including 92 food and drink plants, 41 dye plants, 94 medicinal plants, and 39 for fibres, building, or tanning. To me, this shows that as recent as the late-18<sup>th</sup> century, people here understood how to dwell within their territories in ways that resemble how many Indigenous peoples today relate to theirs.</p>



<p>Anthropologist Tim Ingold (2000: 147, 55) writes, “to live in the world is also to inhabit it. … Knowledge of the world is gained by moving about it, exploring it, attending to it, ever alert to the signs by which it is revealed. Learning to see, then, is a matter not of acquiring schemata for mentally constructing the environment but of acquiring the skills for direct perceptual engagement with its constituents, human and non-human, animate and inanimate.”</p>



<p>Up until last century, a very important word in the Gaelic worldview was <em>Tuath</em>. This word meant both “territory” and “the people of the territory”. The two were understood to be one and the same and inseparable. It’s my understanding that from this utterly interlinked belonging to territory you get other critical ideas in the cosmology such as <em>dùthchas</em> – an idea of belonging that is described by crofter and textile artist Alice Starmore as when “you belong to the land and the land belongs to you” (Farmerama Radio, 2021).</p>



<p>In <em>Tending the Wild: Native American knowledge and the Management of California’s Natural Resources</em>, M. Kat Anderson documents many of the different methods that the Indigenous peoples of California have used to manipulate the “wild” plants and terrains in order to promote the growth of species that were more culturally useful. In it she demonstrates that much of what would have been considered wilderness when first encountered by Europeans was in fact vast territories of carefully tended habitat that had been shaped by thousands of years of native burning, harvesting, tilling, pruning, transplanting, sowing, and scattering. The methods described don’t comfortably fit into either of the binary categories of hunter-gathering or agriculture but, rather, are better described as <em>tending</em>.</p>



<p>“Tend means ‘to have the care of; watch over; look after.’ Thus the word connotes a relationship of stewardship, involvement, and caring very different from the dualistic, exploit-it-or-leave-it-alone relationship with nature still characteristic of Western society. The role of nature’s steward was (and still is) one shared by many indigenous peoples” (Anderson, 2013: 358).</p>



<p>“The foundation of native people’s management of plants and animals was a collective storehouse of knowledge about the natural world, acquired over hundreds of years through direct experience and contact with the environment. The rich knowledge of how nature works and how to judiciously harvest and steward its plants and animals without destroying them was hard earned; it was the product of keen observation, patience, experimentation, and long-term relationships with plants and animals. It was a knowledge built on a history, gained through many generations of learning passed down by elders about practical as well as spiritual practices. This knowledge today is commonly called ‘traditional ecological knowledge’” (Anderson, 2013: 4).</p>



<p>In Gaelic this “traditional ecological knowledge” may be able to be translated as <em>dualchas</em>. Anderson continues, “one learns that Indigenous people achieve deeper intimacy with nature by using it. The character of each tree takes on new dimensions when transformed by human hands through scraping, skinning, soaking, peeling, boiling, mashing, grinding, fire hardening, splitting and decorating. … Each time a person transforms a plant, animal or mineral into a useful item it is an acknowledgement that he or she belongs to a place. … By using nature, we begin to know our place in it”<em> </em>(Anderson, 2013: 338, 363).</p>



<p>Could these ideas be encompassed in Gaelic by the word <em>dùthchas</em>? I believe it’s possible that they could.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>“The most important area of domination was the mental universe of the colonised, the control, through culture, of how people perceived themselves and their relationship to the world. Economic and political control can never be complete or effective without mental control. To control a people’s culture is to control their tools of self-determination in relationship to others.” – Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o, <em>Decolonising the Mind</em></p>



<p><em>Shifting baseline syndrome</em> is a term used in ecology to express how reference points (baselines) for what is perceived as ‘natural’ change in populations over time. Our reference points for what is natural or normal in ecosystems and biodiversity have dramatically changed over the past centuries to the point where we may now perceive highly degraded landscapes as the ‘natural’ state of things – even if the breadth of habitats and richness of biodiversity we know today are just a fraction of what once was. Partially because of this, it can be hard to imagine what our landscapes could be like if they were healthy, vibrant, and fully functional.</p>



<p>This is equally as true with cultural diversity.</p>



<p>What we see today as ‘traditional’ are the leftovers that Gaels were allowed to keep after the land-based culture here was systematically eroded and indeed dismembered.</p>



<p>Arable crops are now only grown on the more fertile eastern parts of the Gàidhealtachd; the Shieling system has long since collapsed and transhumance no longer happens; there is little of the biodiversity that there once was and the traditional knowledge of wild plant use is all but gone.</p>



<p>When the Clearances began, the Shielings were some of the first things to be removed. This was also the time when folks started to be moved away from the old, communal settlements and townships and onto small individually allotted plots of land, called crofts. In processes which starkly paralleled those imposed on many Indigenous peoples all over the world, these crofts were never designed to be able to meet all the needs of subsistence and these new, forced land arrangements pushed the Tuath – the tenantry – into the wage economy in order to survive. Until the end of the 19th century, folks would refer to themselves as the Tuath, and it was only at a later stage that they began to identify as crofters, a term of Germanic origin brought into the region in the times of ‘improvement’ and clearance.</p>



<p>When the Shieling system was beginning to decline in the 17th century, it’s important to note that it was having to coexist with newer, export-oriented systems of droving and commercial forestry. And it is at this point that you start to see evidence of habitat loss due to pressures from overgrazing, and also the extinction of keystone mammals, such as beavers, wild boar, and wolves. The reintroduction of such species is of course a key bone of contention within the whole rewilding debate.</p>



<p>According to Iain MacKinnon (Farmerama Radio, 2021) in a contribution to <em>Landed</em>, an award-winning podcast series sharing the voices behind regenerative farming, “What there has been over the course of the last 300 or 400 years, but particularly the last 150 years, is cultural devastation for Gaelic Scotland. There’s comparatively little left, both in terms of social relations and cultural norms. … We’re living in the debris of our traditional society. We’re living in the wreckage. And we need to reconstitute something from that wreckage that doesn’t exclude or fence people out but supports people to come in and be part of that reconstituting process.”</p>



<p>In order to understand how to recover and reinvigorate some of these traditional land management practices, we need to look to what we know of the ruins from the past. According to sociologist Boaventura de Sousa Santos (2018), these ruins are also the seeds for imagining a hopeful future. The ruins and the wreckage of the past are where we may find some seeds that we can remember, rekindle, revitalise, and reinvent for today.</p>



<p>Some of these ruins may be actual seeds. The Corc beag, or grey oats, that once made up three quarters of the bread foods of the Gaels are no longer cultivated anywhere for human consumption. Indeed, because they’ve been neglected or forgotten for so long as a food, the plant itself is no longer viable as a foodstuff for humans. If I were to mill their grains, I would end up with nothing but dust and husk. Even the few experts who still work with these seeds now doubt that they could ever have been eaten by humans, despite the early accounts. But the seed still exists. To tend them as a foodstuff would involve patient restoration work over a number of decades.</p>



<p>Other ruins may be things like key Gaelic cosmological ideas: Dùthchas, or a sense of belonging to the land or the territory and an interconnection with every part of life within it; Tuath, where the territory and the people of the territory are one and the same; and Dualchas, the transfer of ancestral wisdom of how to live in balance within this territory, within this place.</p>



<p>These are things that were actively dismembered, and then forgotten. But today we are at a point where perhaps it’s time to re-member and repair them. These are keystone concepts for reconstituting the Gàidhealtachd, but they are also <em>just</em> ideas if they can’t be supported by and in turn support real-life practices. The erosion of the ecology and habitats, traditional land practices, lifeways and foodways has gone hand in hand with the erosion of the Gaelic language and its ways of being. The language, the lifeways, and the ways of being on the land are like legs on a stool that hold up a people and a culture. If one falls, they all start to collapse.</p>



<p>What would a decolonised Gaelic landscape look like today? How can we work towards that now? We are living in a time where, one way or another, things are not going to stay the same. Changes in how we go about using the land are inevitable. Today, and certainly tomorrow, there are going to be more and more calls for rewilding and for crofters to change their land practices in response to the various ecological and climate crises.</p>



<p>Is now the time to start to recover some of these lost practices; these ruins of our past? By attempting to revive, repurpose, and reinvent some of these old lifeways, foodways, and ways of interacting with and using the land, we may be able to actively support some of these key Gaelic ideas and cultural practices and by doing so play a role in the reconstitution process Iain Mackinnon mentioned.</p>



<p>In <em>Indigenous Food Sovereignty in the United States,</em> editors Elizabeth Hoover and Devon A. Mihesuah (2019) write, “The concept of Indigenous food sovereignty is not focused only on right to land, food and the ability to control production systems, but also responsibilities to and culturally, ecologically, and spiritually appropriate relationships with elements of those systems. This concept entails emphasizing reciprocal relationships with aspects of the landscape and the entities on it.”</p>



<p>Rewilding is now here and – like it or not – it’s probably here to stay. Yet there is no implicit, fundamental contradiction or even tension between the actual science of rewilding and these traditional ways of being. To me, what we have is an opportunity to present a case for a return to something which could resemble an ‘indigenous’, pre-clearance approach to dwelling in the land.</p>



<p>If there’s money going into purchasing large areas of land to rewild, then we need to ask: what does rewilding look like? Crofting and rewilding are often pitted against each other in a narrative that suggests they are incompatible. But rather than opposing rewilding on the grounds that it is not compatible with the practices that were imposed on the Gàidhealtachd through colonial mechanisms, we should instead start to advocate for embedding these pre-clearance practices into the rewilding agenda and demanding that they are included, considered, and acted upon by people.</p>



<p>It is the very same people who destroyed the Indigenous cultures and land practices who are now calling for a return to the landscape they destroyed. But “Is treasa tuath na tighearna” (The people are mightier than a lord). We need to become the Tuath once more and demand that if this happens it does so in conjunction with a return to ‘indigenous’ land uses, in a relevant and reinvigorated way for today. These ideas need to be invoked now and attempts at living them need to be made. Over the centuries Gaels were domesticated into the state and maybe now is the time for the Tuath to be rewilded.</p>



<p>If folks want to buy up the land to rewild it and that genuinely is their purpose, fine. Buy it up but then give it back to the Tuath to carry this process out. This is a moment and an opportunity to try to remember and invoke these ruin seeds. To move them towards being living seeds once again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Enough! has joined with another 115 charities, economists, businesses, trade unions and academics to send an open letter to Scotland’s First Minister calling for an “urgent transition to a Wellbeing Economy.” Read the statement here: &#8216;<a href="https://www.weallscotland.org/_files/ugd/d7012c_5be16a45f7c9463cbdbae2717202c7a6.pdf?index=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redesigning our Economy for People and Planet: Joint Statement on the Wellbeing Economy (weallscotland.org)</a>&#8216; and the text of the letter below.</strong><br><br><strong>The Enough! Collective believes in the principles and values of a wellbeing economy and supports efforts of civil society to exercise pressure on our government. And we also believe that deeper change won&#8217;t, in fact can&#8217;t happen when we are still wedded to an economic system based on perpetual growth and rampant exploitation.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Redesigning our economy is essential as considerable suffering and loss, resulting from our current economic model, are already being keenly experienced across the globe. For Enough!, well-being for all is only possible if we break with growth.</strong><br><br>Dear First Minister<br><br>We are writing to you as a group of social and environmental justice NGOs, grassroots community groups, faith groups, service providers, funders, economists, academics, think tanks and business leaders united in our belief that Scotland must urgently transition to a Wellbeing Economy.<br><br>Many of us are firefighting to provide frontline support to those swept up in the rising tide of destitution.<br><br>Others among us are trying to play our part in the transition to an economy that values people and the environment, for example, piloting new ways of providing for each other, running community energy projects and deploying alternative business models that contribute to our communities.  Others are directly involved in efforts to restore nature and tackle poverty.<br><br>Too many people in Scotland are living in cold homes, skipping meals and falling behind on rent while Scotland&#8217;s 20 richest families own more wealth than 30 percent of the poorest citizens combined. In the most deprived 30% of Scottish areas life expectancy is falling. At the same time, there are growing fears that Scotland’s legal emissions reductions targets will be missed and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recently warned that the world faces a &#8220;brief and rapidly closing window to secure a liveable future.&#8221; The IPCC also echoed our collective belief that GDP is a poor metric of human<br>wellbeing.<br><br>As a founding member of the Wellbeing Economy Governments partnership, Scotland has played an important role in building momentum for change among governments. We were pleased to see the aspiration to become a Wellbeing Economy contained within Scotland&#8217;s National Strategy for Economic Transformation. We also welcomed the publication of the first iteration of the Wellbeing Economy monitor, efforts to encourage fair work, support for community wealth building and the commitment to review how to increase the number of purposeful and democratic businesses in Scotland. And we are looking forward to seeing the recommendations of the Business Purpose Commission and Just Transition Commission being taken forward. These are steps in the right direction.<br><br>But we are writing to you today because we are concerned that progress isn’t happening fast enough to meet the very real and urgent challenges we face. To date, we have not seen substantive progress in redesigning our economy which continues to break planetary limits and create high levels of inequality.<br><br>With its narrow focus on GDP growth, the National Strategy for Economic Transformation is grounded in the same logic that has delivered decades of poverty, inequality and environmental degradation. What is required now is a robust plan to put the wellbeing of people and nature at the heart of our economy.<br><br>Today we have published a joint statement on what we envision such a Wellbeing Economy to look like in Scotland, which will require actions from governments in both Westminster and Holyrood.<br><br>As next steps on the journey to a Wellbeing Economy we ask you and the Scottish Government to use the powers at your disposal to:<br><strong>Transform the National Performance Framework into a Wellbeing Framework and strengthen its power and reach.</strong><br><br>● In the short-term, this requires a comprehensive engagement process to underpin the review of the National Outcomes so the people of Scotland have a voice in shaping what the framework measures.<br><br>● In the medium term, ensure the upcoming Wellbeing and Sustainable Development Bill puts the wellbeing framework on a stronger statutory footing to provide a clear vision for public bodies, bringing together and strengthening a range of duties to put collective wellbeing and environmental sustainability at the centre of decision-making. This should include enhanced support and scrutiny mechanisms, for example through the promised Future Generations’ Commissioner. The Scottish Government should also bring forward a clear outcome budgeting framework, evidencing how public spending delivers wellbeing outcomes.<br><br><strong>Use devolved tax powers to share Scotland’s wealth more evenly and support public investment in a strong social safety net, universal basic services, fair public sector wages and environmental improvements needed for a Wellbeing Economy.</strong><br><br>● In the short-term, the next Budget should continue progressive moves to increase tax revenue more fairly and clearly set out both the distributional impacts of this and how revenue will be invested in areas that can help Scotland progress to a Wellbeing Economy.<br><br>● In the medium term, the Scottish Government should undertake wide-ranging public<br>engagement to develop options to realise a fully progressive tax system, including more<br>fundamental reforms to income tax rates and bands, a clear roadmap for reforming /replacing the regressive council tax, and options to utilise local tax powers.<br><br><strong>Reshape the business environment in Scotland to facilitate a shift towards purposeful and democratic business practices that support collective wellbeing and environmental sustainability and do not profit from undermining either of them.</strong><br><br>● In the short-term, enterprise agencies and all public business support should prioritise<br>purposeful and democratic business practices, including social enterprises, cooperatives and employee-owned enterprises, as recommended by the Business Purpose Commission. All projects to support entrepreneurship, innovation and start-ups delivered as a part of the<br>National Strategy for Economic transformation should be focused on those businesses that can make the biggest contribution to a Wellbeing Economy and should be tailored to different rural and urban contexts.<br><br>● In the medium-term, fair work conditions on public sector grants and contracts should be<br>strengthened and extended to other dimensions of a Wellbeing Economy, including<br>environmental aspects and democratic governance structures. Options should be developed for better incentivising purposeful business – for example, reforms to non-domestic rates and the introduction of environmental levies.<br><br>Scotland is full of hopeful and inspirational action that is putting the Wellbeing Economy thinking into practice. But transforming such actions into the economy we all need will require bolder action by the Scottish Government to set the direction of the economy, it requires a stronger infrastructure for participation in economic policy-making, ensuring that seldom heard voices are listened to, and it requires increased public investment into places, people and nature to deliver what really matters to people.<br><br>We hope that you will consider our asks and we would be keen to meet to discuss this further.<br><br>Signed by<br>Ailsa Raeburn, Chair, Community Land Scotland<br>Alan McClouskey, Chief Executive, Voluntary Sector Gateway West Lothian<br>Alfie Stirling, Chief Economist, New Economics Foundation<br>Amanda Burgauer, Executive Director, Common Weal<br>Professor Andrew Cumbers, Professor of Political Economy, Adam Smith Business School, University of<br>Glasgow<br>Professor Andrew Watterson, Emeritus Professor of Health, Stirling University<br>Angus Hardie, Director, Scottish Community Alliance<br>Annette Hastings, Professor of Urban Studies, University of Glasgow<br>B.D.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>Dougie Strang interviews Hanna Tuulikki about her new project Seals’kin, and much more.</em> This interview was published in #4 of LESS<strong> </strong>a journal of degrowth, radical sufficiency and decolonisation in Scotland. You can pick up a <a href="https://www.enough.scot/less-distribution-hubs/">free hard copy from our hubs here.</a></p>



<p><em>“Neither one thing nor another thing,”&nbsp;</em>sings Hanna Tuulikki, over and over, providing the vocals for a song on the album&nbsp;<em>Wayward the Fourth</em>&nbsp;by Daniel Padden’s The One Ensemble, released back in 2007. The refrain might serve as a useful epigraph for the body of work that Tuulikki has created since then, work that often explores the space between the human and the non-human – or more-than-human; and just as importantly, explores the possibility of communicating across that space. In a short sound-piece from 2016, she calls out to a raven in a forest in Finland, mimicking the&nbsp;<em>craak craak</em>&nbsp;of the raven’s voice and delighting in its reply.</p>



<p>Hanna Tuulikki is a singer, composer, performance-maker, and visual artist. She studied at Glasgow School of Art, graduating in 2006, and has mostly been based in the city ever since. Her work is ambitious, innovative, and lauded. It&nbsp;includes&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hannatuulikki.org/portfolio/awbirds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Air falbh leis na h-Eòin</em><em>&nbsp;/</em>&nbsp;<em>Away with the Birds</em></a>, a multi-disciplinary project investigating mimesis in traditional Gaelic song, which culminated in a live performance in a harbour on the Isle of Canna in 2014;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hannatuulikki.org/portfolio/cloud-cuckoo-island/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Cloud-cuckoo-island</em></a>, a film-performance created on the Isle of Eigg in 2016 that explores trauma, gender&nbsp;and ecology; and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hannatuulikki.org/portfolio/deer-dancer-live-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Deer Dancer</em></a>, another cross-artform project which looks at representations of deer behaviour and hunting mythologies across different cultures, and which has generated a film and exhibition, premiered at Edinburgh Printmakers in 2019, and a live performance at Glasgow’s Tramway in 2021.</p>



<p>Tuulikki’s latest project,&nbsp;<em>Seals’kin</em>, plays again with the notion of entanglement between the human and the more-than-human. A film of the project was commissioned by the Sydney Biennale, and was created by Tuulikki and her team when they spent a couple of weeks filming in January on the Aberdeenshire coast, at the point where the River Ythan meets the sea, and where colonies of grey and common seals haul themselves out onto the shore.</p>



<p>There are countless folktales, myths, and songs about seal-people, or ‘selkies’ as they are widely known. Two lines in an Orkney ballad, The Great Selkie of Sule Skerry, neatly summaries their condition: ‘I am a man upon the land / I am a selkie upon the sea’. Tales of these shape-shifting creatures, both male and female, continue to resonate in our cultural consciousness, featuring in contemporary films and novels. The poet, Robin Robertson, provides a powerful and dark re-telling of the myth in the poem ‘At Roane Head’ from his 2010 collection&nbsp;<em>The Wrecking Light</em>.</p>



<p>In&nbsp;<em>Seals’kin,&nbsp;</em>Hanna Tuulikki enacts the transformation that lies at the heart of all selkie tales. At the start of the film, we see her in traditional fisherman’s gansey and sou’wester hat, standing on the shore at the river’s mouth and singing to the seals who congregate on the opposite strand; but by the end of the film, she has shifted form and has entered the sea, swimming out and under to meet the seals. The film is mesmerising: gently-paced, beautifully shot, and with a vocal score for human voice that responds to, and at times merges with, the seals’ own singing.</p>



<p>I was keen to speak to Tuulikki about her new project and about the wider question of making art in a time of ecological crisis.</p>



<p><em><strong>Dougie Strang:</strong>&nbsp;The idea of being ‘betwixt and between’ seems to be an enduring aspect of your work.</em></p>



<p><strong>Hanna Tuulikki:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, I’m really interested in meeting points, those spaces in-between, and I’m fascinated by the idea of mimesis – the imitation or embodiment of the more-than-human, whether through vocal improvisation or choreographic movement. Mimesis as a way of thinking or feeling towards, of occupying, those hybrid spaces.</p>



<p><em><strong>DS</strong>: What’s the attraction? Is it simply a desire to communicate, or is it to foster empathy?</em></p>



<p><strong>HT:</strong>&nbsp;It’s so many things. Partly the reason for exploring this space with the body is the inability of language to actually reach those places; so it’s difficult to pinpoint the specifics, but I think empathy is a large part of it, and a feeling of ‘becoming with’, of kinship, of searching for ways to co-exisit with that which is so often considered the ‘other’.</p>



<p><em><strong>DS:</strong>&nbsp;We have a long tradition, going back into pre-history, of making art that seeks to communicate with, to ‘become with’ as you would say, the more-than-human. I’m thinking for example of the paintings in the caves at Chauvet in France. In the past, much of that art, whether paintings, music, or dance, would be part of a wider practice – what we might call Animism or Shamanism – with the specific purpose of mediating between humans and animals, primarily to ensure a successful hunt. But here we are, immersed in the modernity of the 21</em><em>st</em><em>&nbsp;century, yet it seems to me that your work is endowed with something of that shamanic tradition, and I wonder if that’s a conscious decision, and if so, to what purpose?</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><strong>HT:</strong>&nbsp;I’m really interested in this inheritance, and in exploring these practices in vernacular cultures across time and space. To go back to the word ‘mimesis’, its etymology is Ancient Greek, from Plato, who discussed mimesis in terms of the performing arts: the idea that to impersonate the qualities of a character is to make yourself vulnerable to absorbing some of those qualities. But that idea has existed outside of Western culture for aeons, and I’m interested in how we can learn from these practices in order to challenge binary Western thinking and its promotion of human/nature separation. How can we refashion that as a myriad of bodily connections? And in terms of ritual, I’ve been studying different vernacular traditions of mimesis, and seeing the disconnect between what’s encoded in these traditions and the reality of ecological and climate breakdown. So what do such traditions mean now, and how can we work with them as part of ‘the carrying stream’ to create new rituals that help to make sense of the shit-storm we are living in?</p>



<p><em><strong>DS:</strong>&nbsp;How did Seals’kin come about?</em></p>



<p><strong>HT:</strong>&nbsp;It’s one of those projects that has been hovering in my consciousness for a while, and then a few things aligned. I had the Sydney commission and I knew I wanted to work with selkie mythology, and explore what it might mean to ‘become with’ seal. Over the years, I’ve spent a lot of time watching and listening to seals, and I’m fascinated by their voices: this space between crying and singing, it’s an incredible sound.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both grey and common seals are interested in music, and I’ve spent a lot of time singing to them. They come up the Clyde you know, right into the city. During the Glasgow COP26, Judith Williams and I invited people to learn some seal-calling songs and then we led an improvised lamentation down by the river. I told everyone that it was unlikely we’d see seals, but we went down anyway, at high tide, and literally within twenty minutes of singing, a grey seal popped up its head in the water. It was extraordinary, one of those magical moments where it felt like these songs have something special embodied within them, and that we were tapping into that.</p>



<p>I was learning the songs and singing with seals, and researching selkie stories, and I found that so often the songs and tales are about loss and longing – they’re bereavement allegories. Duncan Williamson, the traditional storyteller, writes about how the communities that he was learning these stories from found solace in them. If someone was lost at sea, it was a comfort to think that actually they’d gone to the kingdom of the seal-people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are also malevolent stories where selkies cause havoc with seal-hunters, or by stealing fishermen’s fish, and they seem to be more like cautionary tales, warning us humans about the necessity of co-existence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I began to wonder what these tales can teach us about how to live now, at a time of climate grief – there’s so many different words for it: that sense of despair at what’s happening. Then, last year, my best friend was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and she passed away very suddenly, and I was thrown into an extremely visceral state of grief. So the film is like a mourning ritual, as well as a mediation on loss and longing and co-existence.</p>



<p><em><strong>DS:</strong>&nbsp;I’m so sorry to hear about your friend. I wonder, is the pandemic part of it too, the collective grief at the huge disruption to society and community? Or perhaps that’s a bit facile to throw into the mix?</em></p>



<p><strong>HT</strong>: No, it was in my consciousness, of course. It’s been such a traumatic time for so many of us, and continues to be, we’ve just normalised it… we’ve normalised this pandemic, which I suppose is a useful teacher for how our base-line changes. Think about how we’ve normalised biodiversity loss, species extinction, rises in temperature, though that’s all been happening more slowly, so we don’t see it as clearly.</p>



<p><em><strong>DS:</strong>&nbsp;In the film, that moment when you enter the water in your seal skin costume, how did that feel, knowing that there were seals swimming not far from you, that you were entering their element?</em></p>



<p><strong>HT:</strong>&nbsp;Well, it was January, so it was freezing! But there was also a moment in the water that was like an invitation: seals were popping up all over the place, and I experienced a sense of shared curiosity. That also happened with the sonics: the sound of their calls throughout the filming was like an invitation for me to become more present in my body, as though I was un-numbing myself.</p>



<p>Grief is such a funny thing, you don’t know what’s going to happen the next day or the day after, and I became acutely aware of entering this liminal space, one where you’re simultaneously numb to certain things, but also incredibly sensitive to others; and there was something about that, that I was exploring in relation to skin and to bodies, and to the selkie transformation. The seal skin for me was about agency, and while making the film I had a strong sense of personal transformation. It’s equivocal of course, we can read into it what we want, but for me that ritual of immersion, of swimming, was about un-numbing and giving myself permission to transform; and the skin is like the site of that transformation: there’s the selkie skin, but there’s also my human skin, feeling through the water; this shared visceral feeling between myself and the seals.</p>

<p>t the end of filming, I was swimming in the water and we were running out of daylight, but at that moment there were seals everywhere, some just a meter away, and it was such a magical experience.</p>



<p><em><strong>DS:</strong>&nbsp;Did you have any fear with that? Seals can be fierce!</em></p>



<p><strong>HT:</strong>&nbsp;There was some concern amongst the film crew because there had been recent, local reports of dogs entering the water and being attacked by seals. But it’s funny, I didn’t have fear, even though I didn’t, initially, realise how present the seals would be. I think as long as there’s respect, as fellow-beings, there’s a kind of energy. Maybe that’s a romantic perspective, but it’s how it felt to me.</p>



<p><em><strong>DS:</strong>&nbsp;I’m curious to know if you were able to be fully present during the experience whilst, at the same time, playing a role as a performer who is making a film. I wonder if there were moments where it felt like you really slipped those boundaries?&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><strong>HT</strong>: Because I was filming over a number of days, it became like a durational practice or performance, like attending a ritual space where you’re just doing your thing, but filming it. So when all the seals were popping up it was a genuine connection – they were responding to the singing – and the moments in the film where you pick that up, those are the moments when I’m feeling it too. When you have an encounter with a seal, when you look into each other’s eyes, that curiosity, that’s a very ancient connection. It’s difficult to talk about, but it’s very real.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Nowhere are the ideas of perpetual growth more embedded and more destructive than in our food economy, in which the only metric for ‘success’ is endless growth, export sales, and a ‘productivity’ without recourse to any meaningful sense of quality. The alternative to this is explored here by D<strong>iana Garduño Jiménez</strong> and <strong>Abi Mordin</strong> who describe their “quiet farming revolution” starting in South West Scotland in which farmers across the region have formed a network to exchange knowledge, experience, and practice in the journey to a “regenerative farming”.</em><br>This article was published in #4 of LESS<strong> </strong>a journal of degrowth, radical sufficiency and decolonisation in Scotland. You can pick up a <a href="https://www.enough.scot/less-distribution-hubs/">free hard copy from our hubs here.</a><br></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>“We’re not going to change anything until we start talking and reaching those outside of our echo chambers.”</em></p><p>– Abi Mordin, Agroecologist and Facilitator&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>A quiet farming revolution is starting in South West Scotland. Farmers across the region have formed a group to share knowledge, experience, and practice in the journey to a more sustainable, climate- and nature-friendly way of farming.</p>



<p>The project started in 2021 as part of the Fork to Farm Dialogues – a global project organised by Nourish in the run up to COP26 (the 26<sup>th</sup> United Nations climate change summit convened in Glasgow). The dialogues aimed to bring farmers together with local authority and policy officers, to provide a space to talk about agriculture and climate change.</p>



<p>The dialogue in South West Scotland was organised and facilitated by Abi Mordin, Agroecologist and Facilitator working for local and sustainable food systems as part of Propagate. While most dialogue sessions were held online due to COVID-19, the group also organised two socially distanced Farm Walks in August 2021.</p>



<p>Abi began by writing two informational flyers inviting people to join – one for farmers and one for local authorities. To reach as many farmers as possible, Abi sent flyers to regional networks who were in touch with farmers and land managers. She also used social media, for example, by posting on Facebook groups dedicated to farming materials. To reach local authorities, Abi invited people from relevant departments and asked them to share the invitation with others. The flyers contained a survey link to help Abi find out more about the participants and understand their interest in the project. The group grew to over 50 participants, connected by regular email contact and the monthly online discussions.</p>



<p>Abi did not know most of the people who joined the dialogues – “If I was just going to talk to people that already agreed with me, I’d feel like I was wasting my time.”<em> </em>As an agroecological farmer herself, the range and diversity of attendees was exciting. Abi felt it was critical to move away from a “language of blame” and to understand the broader context in order to engage with different farmers:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>“Today we’ve got these polarised views, and there are these antagonistic camps of, kind of, vegans versus farmers, and rewilders versus farmers, and, you know, farmers feeling like everyone’s just having a go at them. We’re working with people who, especially in this area, are livestock farmers &#8230; most of them feel like they’ve been told that they’re a problem. And &#8230; you know, being told you are a problem when you’re referring to many, many, many generations of somebody’s culture and heritage is not helpful. So, we need to be able to use language that engages these people in a positive way. &#8230; It’s nobody’s fault &#8230; farmers are farming the way they farm is &#8230; because of policy decisions, because of subsidy provisions.”</em></p><p>– <em>Abi</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Abi ensured there was always at least one local authority representative in each session, although it was not always the same person. The broader context in which national policy shapes agriculture in Scotland was a reason why local authorities might not have been as engaged – “Agriculture, it’s national policy, but it’s also a very local issue &#8230; it’s a tricky one to navigate.”<em> </em>Nevertheless, relationships were formed. One particular local authority contacted her to collaborate on developing their communications in ways that would not alienate farmers.</p>



<p>The Farm Walks were critical for meaningful engagement, and proved to be very popular. The first visit was to Torr Organic Dairy Farm near Auchencairn, the second to Caldwell’s Veg near Girvan.</p>



<p>“<em>Could we get a lot more farmers and land managers to farm like this? While it takes time to get there, I think it looks good as an option (potentially financially as well) for whatever subsidy becomes for farmers post-2024.”</em></p>



<p>– <em>Attendee at Torr Farm Walk</em></p>



<p>At both Farm Walks, Abi facilitated a visioning session. “This did put people out of their comfort zones a wee bit!” Each session asked the group to imagine it was 2045, and that at COP26 in November 2021 amazing things had happened: World leaders had come together to agree to radically decarbonise the economy, and farmers had collaborated to fast track agroecology. What do our food and farming systems now look like, smell like and taste like? What people are there and what jobs are they doing?</p>



<p>The discussions from the visioning were captured by an artist, who used the ideas from the group to create a hand-painted image. This image has since been produced as a 28 piece jigsaw, and is used at community events to start conversations on our food and farming futures.</p>



<p><strong>Looking Forward</strong></p>



<p>After COP26, the group took some time to reflect and think about where it wanted to go. Everyone agreed it had been successful and wanted to continue.</p>



<p>A new name was born from suggestions by the group, and it’s now known as the Regenerative Farmers Network for South West Scotland. They agreed not to remove the local authority representatives, as it’s important that this work continues to connect with local policy.</p>



<p>Since January this year, Abi has been producing a weekly email, themed around different aspects of regenerative and nature friendly farming. The email group is open to any farmer in South West Scotland to join and participate in. So far the group has grown to 110 members, with new members joining each week. “The aim is to get conversations going, encourage people to ask questions and share ideas. People respond most to soil – this seems to get folk really excited and curious!”</p>



<p>There’s also a new Facebook group of the same name to provide an additional way for farmers to share and connect.</p>



<p>A Farm Walk has already been held, in partnership with Pasture for Life Scotland. The group visited Balsar Glen near Girvan, who practice mob grazing – moving the livestock daily to nourish soil and animal health – with their herd of Herefords and Aberdeen Angus cattle. Attendees really valued “seeing the local reality and hearing the experience first hand”, and “seeing different farming techniques in practice and meeting others”.</p>



<p>More Farm Walks are planned – in May the group are visiting Trostrie Farm near Twynholm to hear about innovative approaches to using sheep in a mob grazing system, and in July there is a visit arranged to a 1acre walled garden near Laurieston, Castle Douglas, which has been producing organic fruit and veg for over 40 years.</p>



<p>The group are also planning to carry out a collective soil monitoring and observation project, using the Soil Mentor platform to collect information on soil health and biodiversity, and farmers can use it to benchmark and compare each other’s interventions and management.</p>



<p>“I’m excited for the future”, Abi says. “More Farmers are coming on board now to whom this is totally new – it’s gaining traction and facilitators and practitioners like me can see the change. We’re not alone! Great projects like Agroecology: Facilitating Mindset Change have happened across Scotland and paving the way for a healthier, equitable, and food future that’s ultimately better for all of us”.</p>

<p><br>In their focus on mining in Galloway, <strong>Annie Morgan</strong> and <strong>Nayab Khalid</strong> look from the particular to the global to talk of Martin Arboleda’s “planetary mine”. This thread is a recurring one of rooting action in place and time but drawing back to see a wider and deeper picture. For Morgan and Khalid, Arboleda’s “concept of ‘global colony’ with interconnected infrastructures and technologies that transverse the entire globe … highlights the importance of understanding and challenging the extractivist model as a whole”.<br><br>This article was published in #4 of LESS<strong> </strong>a journal of degrowth, radical sufficiency and decolonisation in Scotland. You can pick up a <a href="https://www.enough.scot/less-distribution-hubs/">free hard copy from our hubs here.</a><br><br>“<em>So, while for the adivasis the mountain is still a living deity, the fountainhead of life and faith, the keystone of the ecological health of the region, for the corporation, it&#8217;s just a cheap storage facility.</em>”</p>



<p>&#8211; Arundhati Roy, speaking about the adivasi communities in south India and their struggle against mining corporations [1]</p>



<p>The slogan ‘Think Global: Act Local’ has meaning in the recent campaign against exploratory mining in Dumfries &amp; Galloway run by the grassroots group Galloway Against Mining (GAM).&nbsp;</p>



<p>In late 2021, JDH Exploration &#8211; a subsidiary of the Australian mining company Walkabout Resources &#8211; began exploratory drilling operations in Dumfries &amp; Galloway, after being granted exploration licences from the Crown Estate in 2018. The area of exploration covers the proposed Galloway National Park, and includes Blackcraig Wood, a UNESCO biosphere region and an area of astounding natural beauty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Galloway Against Mining was established in early 2022 following alarm surrounding exploratory drilling activity in the Blackcraig area. Currently at around 1400 members, including local people and supporters, GAM focuses on on-the-ground activism and raising awareness.</p>



<p>We spoke to GAM member Kenny Campbell for this article. Kenny is a resident of Newton Stewart, and only found out about the drilling activity (similarly to other GAM members) in January this year. Kenny described the process of discovering the mining activity as “traumatic”, with residents waking up one day to drilling activity “essentially in their back gardens”. One of the residents, an elderly lady, “felt like she was being assaulted”. Kenny has expressed frustration at the opaque nature of the mining and exploration process, stating “you’re not sure where the next bore-hole location will be”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In January 2022, Walkabout Resources (WR) took full ownership of JDH Exploration, after acquiring the remaining equity in an Earn-In Agreement. The acquisition gives WR 100% ownership of more than 750 square kilometres of exploration licences in southwest Scotland, which includes what they are calling ‘the Blackcraig Lead-Zinc-Silver Project’ within the Crown Estate in D&amp;G. WR are an Australian based mining company, listed on the Australian Stock Exchange.&nbsp; The choice of the name Walkabout is also indicative of the appropriation of the Australian Aboriginal tradition. This immediately raises the question of bringing the resource curse to Scotland: who will benefit, distant shareholders?&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>“I have nothing against mining, many of my ancestors were miners. What I am against is companies coming in and destroying our landscape for their own gain with little to no care or respect shown to the locals or the local wildlife. The promise of &#8216;jobs&#8217; and &#8216;we haven&#8217;t broken the law yet&#8217; is not enough to sway me.”</em></p><p>– Adam Walsh, Galloway Against Mining</p></blockquote>



<p>We spoke to a local nurse involved with the campaign who wished to remain anonymous, she expressed concerns about the impact on health. Historically mining is notoriously toxic, and damages both human and ecosystem health. While JDH/WR claim that modern mining practices are ‘designed to avoid the unfortunate practices of the past’, it is worth noting that even modern metal mining &#8211; especially gold mining &#8211; produces toxic pollution. Toxic sodium cyanide remains the primary reagent for gold processing because it alloys for efficient extraction of low-grade gold ore.</p>



<p>There is also anxiety about damage to water supply in the region &#8211; Soltway Firth, North Channel, River Cree, as well as concerns about the impact on biodiversity and birdlife (starlings).&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is worth noting here that GAM are not the only group formed as a reaction to the exploratory drilling in D&amp;G. The Galloway Mines Action Group (GMAG) were also formed in early 2022, and seek to have a more formal status as a ‘regulator’ instead of the on-the-ground activism of GAM. They are in the process of registering with OSCR, with acting chair Christopher Glen and acting secretary Susan Miller.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>“Galloway Mines Action Group (GMAG) has been established to confront the challenges posed by Walkabout Resources mining activities across Galloway. GMAG has concerns about toxic pollution, radioactive release, ecological damage and the destruction of historically and culturally important sites and protected habitats and is seeking to protect Galloway from irresponsible mining. We are principally a research based group which will produce evidence to inform the decision making processes, in particular any formal planning applications, and provide information to enable individuals, stakeholders and mining interest groups to form their own views and respond effectively to proposals.”</em></p><p>– Susan Miller, Galloway Mines Action Group&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p><strong>Public relations exercises</strong></p>



<p>In order to diffuse public tensions in D&amp;G, JDH Exploration have held a series of public meetings and consultations beginning in January 2022, organised in tandem with community councils. These meetings, dubbed by locals as ‘public relations exercises’ talk up the transition to ‘clean energy’ required to mitigate against climate change and include the promise of local employment. Globally, Walkabout Resources place themselves as key players in ‘green transition’ metal mining and the recent public consultations in D&amp;G focused on this. JDH Exploration community liaison officer Nigel Bradley introduced the notion that WR have an essential role in critical metal mining for a green transition.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Despite much research I have yet to come upon a verifiable “good news” story about the impacts of mining on local communities &#8211; so it will take a lot to convince me that mining in D&amp;G should go ahead.”</em></p>



<p>– Peter W., Galloway Against Mining</p>



<p>Nigel Bradley also discussed how Walkabout Resources graphite mining operations in Tanzania (operating as Lindi Jumbo Ltd) brought benefit to the community. The reality is very different &#8211; Tanzania remains one of the poorest countries per capita income in the world. The graphite mining operations in Tanzania carry the narrative of improving infrastructure and building health centres and schools. The narrative excludes the environmental impacts of their mining and the severing of people from land and traditional agricultural methods.</p>



<p>According to Bradley, throughout the exploration process the company has consulted with D&amp;G Council, Forestry and Land Scotland, Cree Valley Community Council, Scottish Environment Protection Agency, private landowners, and local media outlets. However, many D&amp;G residents claim that there has been a lack of transparency in these consultations, and environmental assessments have not been made publicly available. The public meetings beginning in January this year were the first time locals have been made privy to any details about the operation.</p>



<p>The ‘public relations exercises’ also emphasised that the company is at the ‘exploration’ phase, i.e., drilling is a number of years away and may not be progressed. There is no mention of the environmental costs of exploration and the often little provision for restoration. The UNESCO site classification has also not offered protection in what is being described as exploration of ‘green transition’ metals and minerals. The promise of local employment has also been reiterated many times in the public consultations, but if there is one thing post-industrial Scotland knows well it is that mining jobs are often a myth.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“The jobs never last.”</em></p>



<p>– Kenny Campbell, Galloway Against Mining</p>



<p>JDH Exploration have recently completed collecting both bore-hole and top-soil samples from their exploration sites, and these have been sent to laboratories in the Republic of Ireland for analysis. Results were expected in February 2022 but have not yet been forthcoming. According to Kenny, the delay in results being made available might imply that the company is preparing their application for a mining permit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>GAM members have expressed frustration about the lack of support residents and activists have received from local politicians and council members. Kenny has pointed out that local councils have often assisted JDH Exploration by providing a venue for their public meetings. While sympathetic, South Scotland list MSP Emma Harper and councillor for Mid Galloway and Wigtown West Katie Hagmann have both indicated that action can only be taken at Scottish Government level if a full mining permit is applied for.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The Planetary Mine</strong></p>



<p>For 500 years European colonialism and the mechanisms of postcolonialism &#8211; i.e., extractive colonialism &#8211; have resulted in making our entire planet a colony. Now ‘green colonialism’ threatens the existence of frontline indigenous communities in a similar way. We borrow concepts from Martin Arboleda’s ‘Planetary Mine’ [2] and aim to describe antidotes to the precarious situation we have arrived at. A true and international sustainability, beyond extractivism, and a call to environmentalists to understand the importance of the structural, socio-economic, systemic changes necessary.</p>



<p>Arboleda’s analysis goes beyond colonialism and postcolonialism, and develops the concept of&nbsp;</p>



<p>‘global colony’ with interconnected infrastructures and technologies that transverse the entire globe, and hence highlights the importance of understanding and challenging the extractivist model as a whole. This approach connects global communities, and Arboleda takes heart in the fact that resistance to mining can re-establish ways of living that are in balance with nature, placing human concerns on an equal footing with other species. In tracing the intersecting transfer of minerals and metals from the colonised countries of South America to the growing cities of East Asia, he explores the ongoing ‘resource curse’ evident in the lack of benefit in the countries of primary extraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We acknowledge the necessity of breaking from fossil dependence for energy but question the position of transnational companies, including fossil fuel corporations, and the infinite growth model. The urgency towards addressing the climate crisis cannot be overstated, but replacing fossil extraction with the renewable narrative does not change the reality of exploitation of land and people. Use of force, environmental impacts, degradation of soil, depletion of water, tailing disasters &#8211;&nbsp; the list is long. It is not just mine workers whose health is destroyed but whole communities, with peri-urbanisation and urbanisation, mining and shanty towns severing people from land, family and community, and so on. Violence and conflict are integral in the imposition of mining throughout the majority world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is vitally important that the environmental movements recognise that changes are not just required in terms of carbon emissions reduction. Since extractivism is fundamentally rooted in injustice, solutions must go beyond the ‘extractive frontier’ [3] and look into reduction in demand. Reducing primary demand in countries with no processing facilities is a priority and structural transformation is required to challenge the growth model. A shift away from Gross Domestic Product and the pursuit of profit as an aspiration and indicator of wealth is necessary. Reducing demand for energy is key.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mining is one of the main pull factors in urbanisation, the large-scale transition and centralisation of people and resources. The exponential rise of cities and megacities globally creates more demand for energy which in turn accelerates the expansion of mining – a vicious circle. Very high levels of consumption, the concentration of economic activity, sealed surfaces (roads and buildings) which absorb and retain solar irradiation, air conditioning, cars and road freight all exacerbate climate damage.</p>



<p>The recent drive to locate mining in the ‘Global North’ where it is argued that regulations and new mining technologies will alleviate harm does not hold up. Eastern Europe has the second most devastating tailing incident on record. Turkey had a tragic mining accident in 2014, the Soma mine explosion killed 301 people and President Edrogan was reported as saying that death went with the job [4]. Mount Ida in North West Turkey, a sacred mountain in ethnic and religious traditions and an area of breathtaking beauty, is currently the site of Canadian mining. The Sampi regions of North Scandinavia, home of the Sami peoples, are increasingly under threat from mining activities. In Portugal and Serbia, conflict over planned Lithium mining is current [5].</p>



<p>It is also helpful to understand the process of colonialism in Scotland and Ireland here. Currently 27% of the Republic of Ireland is given to mining concessions and 25% of Northern Ireland [6]. The colonial history of the Celtic lands is pertinent within the concepts explored above: the Highland Clearances (as well as the Lowland Clearances), the forcible removal of crofters from land, the devastation of culture and historic agricultural practice &#8211; so well illustrated in John McGrath’s acclaimed theatre productions ‘The Cheviot, the Stag and the Black Black Oil’, dispossession, forced evictions, emigration, urbanisation, the Colonial famine in Ireland.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Natural capital</strong></p>



<p>In 2013, Sian Sullivan [7] voiced concerns about the International Union of the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) adopting the term ‘natural capital’ amid growing concerns around the promotion and promises of the ‘Green Economy’. Quoting Einstein, “we cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them”, Sullivan expressed concern that economic language rather than ecological language was prominent in the adoption of ‘natural capital’ discourse. More recently, George Monboit described how the language of markets has changed how our obligations to land have become embedded in commercial relationships.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is relevant in the Scottish context. Mairi McAllan, the Scottish Minister Environment, Biodiversity and Land Reform, used the term in response to concerns that changes to the Land Reform Bill in 2023 will not go far enough in enabling communities to lead their own development. Ms McAllan told MSPs in December 2021 that the Land Reform Bill ‘offers opportunities to take action to increase levels of natural capital value to harness ways to benefit communities’. She suggested further that it is important to find pathways that balance the need for private sector investment with legal commitments to a ‘just transition’ in land ownership and use. While a commitment to a diverse pattern of land ownership as well as public ownership of community land is the stated aim of the Land Reform Bill, her comments also included the assertion that the focus of the reform is on how land is used rather than the wider question of foreign ownership.</p>



<p>Currently, Scotland has one of the most unequal land ownerships in Europe, with just 500 people owning more than half of the land. Investigations by The Ferret [8] in 2020 revealed that 60% of foreign-owned land in Scotland was bought by companies based in tax havens. Many Russian oligarchs also own large estates. Vladimir Lisin, who got very very rich from steel extraction and ripping off Russian workers after the collapse of the Soviet Union, received public money to the tune of £700,000 for his estate near Crieff. On the Cowal Peninsula, Vladimir Strzhalkovsky, the former CEO of Norilsk Nickel, bought the historic estate while his main residence is in the tax haven of Monaco.</p>



<p>Perhaps this is why Andy Wightman, now sitting as an Independent MSP, says that fundamental reforms to land have not yet been embraced by the Scottish administration. This is not to suggest that Land Reform legislation is not important. The Scottish Government’s Land Reform Act of 2003 paved the way for community ownership in North Harris, Eigg, Gigha, Knoydart, Assyant and others. Community Land Scotland questions the so-called ‘Green Lairds’, millionaires with wilderness/rewilding projects in mind. These privileged elites are intending to live out their visions of conservation in an artificial creation. This could continue the process of excluding people from the land.</p>



<p>Returning to Galloway, the internal colonisation of land is apparent in how the Australia-based Walkabout Resources is currently exploring Crown Land. According to Kenny, the current mining issue is “really is about land reform and nothing else”. The GAM campaign to prevent the exploitation of people and land by a foreign company is of timely significance. Communities leading their own vision for developing their environments is vital.</p>



<p><em>“There would be no mining if the land was not made available. Perhaps the main focus of your efforts should be channelled there. Name and shame the landowners for starters.”</em></p>



<p>– Peter Horsell, Galloway Against Mining</p>



<p><strong>Solutions</strong></p>



<p><em>“We live in capitalism. Its power seems inescapable. So did the divine right of kings. Any human power can be resisted and changed by human beings. Resistance and change often begin in art, and very often in our art, the art of words.”</em></p>



<p>― Ursula K. Le Guin</p>



<p>Around the world communities are rising up and pushing back the frontier of extractivism and implementing solutions rooted in reducing demand and restoring ecological balance. Calls for a mass movement are frequently referred to in eco-socialist literature. The current campaign in D&amp;G can inform what needs to happen and build solidarity networks for empowerment. Community land based solutions are key. This can mean land reform and moves towards public ownership of land, housing, transport, energy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Beyond protest, the challenge is to build meaningful alternative economies. Quoting Colin Macleod (GalGael Trust, Pollok Free State), “That was protest, this is building.” The trade union movement could be at the forefront in this, going beyond ‘jobs at any cost’ to climate jobs within a just transition &#8211; a transition rooted in global climate justice, recognising the importance of international organisations like Trade Unions for Energy Democracy and Yes to Life No to Mining.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Back in Galloway, our conversation with Kenny Campbell included ideas around sustainable and heritage tourism, book festivals &#8211; including the famous Wigtown Book Festival, nature walks, ecological restoration vacations &#8211; possibly alongside organisations like Worldwide Opportunities on Organic Farms (WWOOF). Kenny stressed the importance of alternative affordable accommodations such as bunkhouses, independent hostels, and yurts.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“[We need] an underlying solutions focused approach that addresses climate change and environmental destruction, so approaches that involve sustainable development such as properly connected public transport, sustainable tourism like the Book Festival and the TRAD Music Festival, heritage such as The Museum and the various activities in Whithorn and beyond, accommodation like the various bunkhouses.”</em></p>



<p>– Kenny Campbell, Galloway Against Mining</p>



<p>This is all facilitated by integrated public transport, so the need for a better public transport system in rural D&amp;G was stressed. The solutions around public transit connecting urban and rural towns and villages can bring a sharing of locally based initiatives around growing and making, alongside the sharing of vision and support.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“One of the biggest areas of land on these islands, D&amp;G needs good, reliable and affordable public transport . Sadly this has not been the case, mainly since Thatcher&#8217;s privatisation in the 80&#8217;s &#8211; which saw prices increase 300%, and the closing of the Dumfries to Stranraer railway line back in the 60&#8217;s. Campaigns like &#8216;Haud the Bus D&amp;G&#8217;, and another to reinstate the railway line are gathering pace, giving many in the region a voice that needs to be heard. Sadly listening and making it easy for a mining company to threaten the environment of the area&#8217;s stunning landscapes and ecosystem is more of a priority for some. “</em></p>



<p>– Danny Alderslowe, local activist and campaigner</p>



<p>GAM have connected with organisations like the London Mining Network, and are keen to forge connections with other like-minded people. They learn from and support the struggles of indeginous communities around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“We are very far from alone in our struggle with Walkabout, and there are communities large and small across the globe defending their land just as we are.”</em></p>



<p>– Kenny Campbell, Galloway Against Mining</p>

<p>The infographic is a pull-out poster with the magazine, you can get it <a href="https://www.enough.scot/less-distribution-hubs/">HERE.</a></p>



<p>The Number One of our Top Twenty is <strong>Peterhead Power Station</strong>. It burns North Sea gas. C02 emissions from 2020 were 1,294,000t</p>



<p>Number Two is <strong>Grangemouth Refinery</strong> (a 50:50 venture by Ineos and PetroChina) which had 2020 emissions of 1,036,000t.</p>



<p>Number Three is an old favourite &#8211; <strong>ExxonMobil&#8217;s Mossmorran Ethylene Plant</strong> in Fife which &#8211; as well as contaminating and disturbing the local community &#8211; spews out 902,000t of emissions (2020).</p>



<p>In at Number Four is Ineos &#8211; <strong>Grangemouth Chemical Plant.</strong> The plant produces ethylene, ethanol, and polypropylene and emits 615,000t per year (2020).</p>



<p>Number 5 makes a hat-trick for Grangemouth with <strong>Ineos&#8217;s gas-fired CHP Plant</strong> &#8211; which emits 615,000t of C02 emissions.  <br><br>Based on <a href="https://theferret.scot/rogues-gallery-climate-polluters-top-20-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Rogues Gallery </a>&#8220;of the most climate-trashing sites in Scotland” by Rob Edwards and Paul Dobson in which they argued that oil and gas companies “cannot be trusted to lead the transition to a zero-carbon economy”.<br><br>Design by Andy Arthur @cocteautriplets</p>
